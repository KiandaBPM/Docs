FROM HELP???
Yes sure. You can redirect the user anywhere with the Close rule. By default, all forms come with a close button, however, you can set a close rule yourself, to do so:

Select the button you want
Click on add rule > Form actions > Close form
Add a title to the rule
Select the action you want to execute after closing the form
Auto will redirect the user to the last location they were before opening the form
Return to a dashboard will redirect the user to a dashboard of your choice
Return to URL will redirect the user to any URL specified

Warning: you cannot use Close form and Go to form in the same button.
