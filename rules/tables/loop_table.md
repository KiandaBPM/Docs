FROM HELP??
If you need to perform loop actions on table, you can do so with Loop tables under Add a rule. In the example, we are importing data using the file and performing loop action on the 'Set Complete' button.

In this case, we need to set form field value of 'Status' to 'Complete'.

Select 'Loop Complete' button.
Go to 'Add a rule'.
Select 'Tables'.
Select 'Loop table'.
Select a table 'List of tickets'.
Select column field which needs to be triggered.
