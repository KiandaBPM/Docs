# Rules #

Business rules are what makes Kianda forms come alive. They represent the actual actions users intend to perform when they interact with form components.

## Getting started with Rules ##

If you go to **Administration** > **Designer** and click on a process or create a new process, the predefined rules are found in the left-hand pane.
