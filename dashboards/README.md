### ## Dashboard widgets ###

Kianda offers real-time monitoring dashboards for use on mobile, tablet or desktop devices. Using Kianda dashboards, you could easily configure a process dashboard or home page in minutes with the help of widgets. Kianda comes with 7 predefined widgets as listed below.

- **Rich text**: The Rich text is used to display some texts, links or images on the dashboards.
- **Tile**: A tile is used to display a count of instances with different colour schemes. You could also add conditions to display count, for example, you could add a condition “Status” equals “In-progress”, this will display the count of instances with status “In-progress”.
- **Chart:** Using a chart widget, you could create a pie chart, bar chart or a line chart. These charts could be used to represent various conditions on a process.
- **List:** The list widget displays the instances of the selected process. List widget could also be used to connect with any other widget to display the filtered items, see [List widgets](dashboards/listwidgets.md) for more details.
- **Filter:** The filter widget is used to filter the instances based on a field. For example, process instances could be filtered by status.
- **Link:** The link widget is used to add a link to a new process, dashboard or any external sources such as SharePoint.
- **Walk-through:** This widget allows you to create a walk-through quickly which could be made available to a user, group or an organisation.
