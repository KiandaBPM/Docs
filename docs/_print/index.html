<source src=/videos/designerintro.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=predefined-fields>Predefined fields</h2><p>Kianda comes with 16 predefined field widgets, see <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/add-controls-and-rules/>Controls</a> for a full list. You can also use <a href=/docs/getting-started/welcome/low-code/>Kianda Developer</a> to create custom fields if you have some development experience and none of the predefined field widgets satisfy your specific needs.</p><p>The default fields fall into four main categories:</p><ol><li><strong>Input</strong> - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields.</li><li><strong>Layout</strong> - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields.</li><li><strong>Action</strong> - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components.</li><li><strong>Custom</strong> - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields developed using <a href=/docs/getting-started/welcome/low-code/>Kianda Developer</a>.</li></ol><p>For example, layout fields play an important role when building a modern user interface as they allow you to add <strong>Richtext</strong> and <strong>Dialog boxes</strong>. You can use these fields together to create a modal dialog, allowing you as the form designer to create an alert for a form user - for example, when requiring user confirmation or making a final decision or check.</p><p><em><strong>Example of fields in action - creating a modal dialog</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src=/videos/modaldialog.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=responsive-form-layout>Responsive form layout</h2><p>Form fields are made to with a mobile-first approach, giving you design once and deploy everywhere opportunity.</p><p>By using the <strong>Layout</strong> option in the property panel, you will be able to simply define the layout of your fields or panels within a form. Clicking on the <strong>Collapse or expand</strong> <img src=/images/collapse.PNG alt="Collapse or expand"> button quickly uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.</p><p><img src=/images/layout.png alt="Layout mode"></p><p>This allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows you to design web interfaces with a mobile-first approach. You can see this layout in action in this video.</p><p><em><strong>Editing forms</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src=/videos/editfields_inuse.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=properties-and-settings>Properties and settings</h2><p>Kianda form usability is brought to life with the help of the various input fields that are specifically adapted to work in mobile, tablet or desktop modes.</p><p>For each type of input field - such as textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table - Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be <strong>adjusted</strong> through properties and settings to work with a myriad of scenarios.</p><p>Each field comes with its own range of settings like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input.</p><p>These are some of the common properties of input fields:</p><ul><li>Title - Each field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user.</li><li>Required - Using this checkbox makes a field mandatory for form users to fill in.</li><li>Visible - Displays the field in the form if checked.</li><li>Layout - Defines both desktop or mobile layout.</li></ul><p>In addition to these common properties, each field also has its own range of settings. For example, a <strong>list</strong> can have data entered manually, via a form, or from an external data source such as SharePoint or Salesforce and that list can be displayed as a dropdown, radio, multiselect or checkbox list.</p><h2 id=connecting-to-datasources>Connecting to datasources</h2><p>By connecting Kianda forms to existing external datasources such as lists in SharePoint, Google Drive or SQL tables, your processes will always stay relevant, up-to-date and perform as your data grows, creating a scalable solution.</p><p>There are currently 19 different predefined data connectors that allow you to connect external data sources to Kianda processes, as outlined in this video.</p><p><em><strong>Example connecting to a SharePoint datasource</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src=/videos/dataconnectsharepoint.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><p>The example in the video shows how a list field that is connected to SharePoint information can be used in a form, so that as the list grows on SharePoint, the information in the Kianda process will update dynamically.</p><p>The list field, in conjunction with datasources, allows you to define an unlimited level cascading dropdown hierarchy very easily.</p><h3 id=cascading-dropdown-example>Cascading dropdown example</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s say, for example, that you have SharePoint or Salesforce lists of customers in different countries and different cities. You can then use the list data source conditions options to filter content based on that parent list.</p><p>This video shows how cascading lists connected to data sources works in practice.</p><p><em><strong>How to create cascading dropdowns</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

This video goes through some of the possiblities you have when building forms with Kianda.</p><p><em><strong>Examples of possibilities with Kianda forms</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src=/videos/possibilities.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=rules>Rules</h2><p>Rules are an important component of any process as they can be used to trigger automated actions, requiring minimal user management once created. There are 60 predefined rules in Kianda, covering areas such as workflow applications, communications and file management.</p><p>This video goes through an example of a rule that sends an automated email once a Submit button is clicked on a form.</p><p><em><strong>Examples of possibilities with Kianda forms</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src=/videos/rules.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=anonymous-forms>Anonymous Forms</h2><p>Anonymous forms are a great way of allowing people outside of your organisation to interact with your processes - for example, simple feedback forms to GDPR data requests that hop between multi divisions before sending back a response to the requester with the level of information held by the organisation.</p><p>Even with a simple contact form or feedback form, the process rarely ends when the form is submitted. There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result that goes back to the person who started the submission.</p><p>Anonymous forms can be embedded in iframes and safely displayed within other web-based applications.</p><h2 id=dashboards>Dashboards</h2><p>Use Kianda&rsquo;s predefined widgets to create charts in a dashboard page for your process. There are seven different widgets that allow you to visualise different aspects of your process, allowing you to zone in on key data you want to highlight.</p><p><em><strong>Creating a dashboard</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

It is particularly useful in situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.</p><p>Custom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. If you need to build &ldquo;an action&rdquo;, then you should use a custom rule widget.</p><p>Custom fields allow developers to build a reusable component that can then be used by process designers in real processes.</p><p>Check-out the <a href=/docs/getting-started/welcome/low-code/>development</a> section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To start your no-code development journey, follow these simple steps:</p><p><img src=/images/one.png alt=1> <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/><strong>Plan your process</strong></a></p><p><img src=/images/two.png alt=2> <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/><strong>Design and build your process</strong></a></p><p><img src=/images/three.png alt=3> <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/publish-your-process/><strong>Publish your process</strong></a></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-f7594d67f49229ab5e8428b59b548249>1.1.3 - What is Low-Code Development?</h1><p>Low-code development offers <strong>software developers</strong> a shortcut to create something new and beneficial for their organisation. Rather than having to think about every single line of code, as a developer you can take advantage of Kianda&rsquo;s <strong>Developer</strong> section to create your own custom widgets from predefined field, rule and dashboard code.</p><p>You can also quickly use Kianda <strong>Developer</strong> to add <a href=#webhooks>webhooks</a>, providing an efficient way to push GET requests to other applications in real-time as the Kianda process runs and avoiding the need to poll for data.</p><p>Kianda uses EmberJS to build widgets, and in particular the Handlebars templating library, to power the application&rsquo;s user interface. See <a href=#emberjs-templating-basics>templating basics</a> to get started.</p><h2 id=emberjs-templating-basics>EmberJS templating basics</h2><p>With Handlebars you can quickly build web applications that are made up of different components. Handlebar templates contain static HTML and dynamic content inside Handlebars expressions, which are summoned with double curly braces: {{ }}</p><p>Dynamic content inside a Handlebars expression is rendered with data-binding. This means if you update a property, your usage of that property in a template will be automatically updated to the latest value.</p><h3 id=helpers>Helpers</h3><p>Ember gives the ability to write your helpers, to bring a minimum of logic into Ember templating. For example, let&rsquo;s say you would like the ability to add a few numbers together, without needing to define a computed property everywhere you would like to do so.</p><p><em><strong>Helper example</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/write-our-own-helpers.png alt=Helpers></p><h4 id=conditionals>Conditionals</h4><p>Statements like <strong>if</strong> and <strong>unless</strong> are implemented as built-in helpers. Helpers can be invoked three ways; inline invocation, nested invocation and block invocation.

For example, SharePoint Online Environment and Active Directory, SAP, SQL Server, O365 and Oracle.</p><h2 id=quality-assurance>Quality Assurance</h2><p>To ensure Kianda meets the highest quality assurance levels, we employ a number of methodologies, including:</p><ul><li>Kianda is <strong>ISO 27001 ISMS certified</strong> and audited by an external party every 6 months. Details can be accessed here: <a href=https://www.kianda.com/information-security>https://www.kianda.com/information-security</a>.</li><li>Kianda follows agile methodologies for managing product development and project deliveries. Team members are certified in Agile Project Management and Scrum Framework, ensuring we deliver best practice project documentation and product development cycles.</li><li>Kianda’s Information Security Management System (ISMS) policy is designed to protect Kianda’s information assets as well our clients’ information from all threats (whether internal or external, deliberate or accidental), to provide a security approach that satisfies our clients, and to ensure a solid understanding of security requirements and risk management practices and effective communication of security to all Kianda employees, contractors, partners, clients and third parties.</li><li>Kianda’s Information Security Policy ‘Security in Development and Support Processes&rsquo; covers Patch Management Processes, Technical Review of Operating System Changes Restrictions on Changes to Software Packages and Product Development stages.</li><li>Kianda regularly backs-up adequate copies and generations of all software, documentation and business information. Regular testing is carried out to ensure the quality and usability of backed-up resources.</li></ul><p>The Kianda Platform <strong>fully complies with General Data Protection Requirements</strong> (GDPR) and is being continually improved, with an enhancement roadmap in place.</p><h3 id=security-and-authentication>Security and Authentication</h3><p>The Kianda platform <strong>provides Single Sign On (SSO)</strong> capability with SharePoint or OneLogin. This allows users to create, view and approve forms by first logging in with their Active Directory (AD) account.</p><p>Security is provided by integration with the Clients Active Directory / O365 or other Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requirements. It can synchronise users and their groups from SharePoint, O365 or AD. The platform provides the ability for external users to integrate with SSO and MFA authentication via guest users in O365.</p><p>Kianda can be linked with active directory groups set up by the client to control permissions. The system can synchronize with the existing permissions from AD.</p><h3 id=user-management>User Management</h3><p>The Kianda platform allows for <strong>different users to have different security privileges</strong>, providing for easy administrative management of users and their access rights. Our platform allows the following user levels by default:</p><ul><li>User -can only access what is assigned to them. For example, forms and dashboards.</li><li>Administrator - can access (view and edit) all</li><li>Manage partners/customers - can only access what is required to manage customer portals</li><li>Design business process - can only design business forms and workflows</li><li>Manage data sources - can only manage data sources and connections</li><li>Developer - can design new widgets within the platform</li></ul><p>The platform allows for the creation of user groups and the ability to assign these user groups to processes or dashboards as needed. Dashboard levels or particular widgets can be configured to only be visible to certain users or groups of users and data source connections can be configured in the same way to ensure the highest access control levels.</p><p>Our data classification system has been designed to support access to information based on the need to know, so that information will be protected from unauthorised disclosure, use, modification and deletion.</p><p>The Kianda platform ensures that data is never transmitted in clear text or stored in a database or file solution. The platform is hosted in MS Azure with enterprise-grade security. All data generated is encrypted at rest and in transit. Data records are also masked from a GDPR point of view. We employ Microsoft security products to automatically mask and classify personal data - which is scheduled weekly.</p><p>Overall, Kianda Technologies follows ISO ISMS policies, GDPR best practices and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) guidelines for product development. Kianda Technologies will also adhere to Client security standards.</p><h3 id=ease-of-use>Ease of use</h3><p>The Kianda Platform offers administrative interfaces that are private and segregated from user interfaces.</p><p>Kianda forms, by default, provide edit and reassign functions that are only available to admin users or configurable roles within the system. These quick actions allow admin users to make changes to an existing form record when needed. Any <strong>changes made</strong> <strong>by</strong> <strong>any user are logged</strong> in the Audit History.</p><p>In terms of designing new forms or making changes to existing designs, admin users have the ability to preview their changes before publishing within the design interface. Changes only become visible to end-users after the process or form has been published. In addition, <strong>live and test environments are provided</strong> to enterprise clients, providing the ability to test in the test environment before publishing to live.</p><p>For further ease of use, error messages are configurable within the Kianda platform. They can be created freely when forms are being designed to ensure scenarios such as data validation or indicating the next course of action. This gives flexibility to form designers to define error messages as needed.</p><p>It is easy to learn how to optimally use the Kianda platform. Kianda training is delivered by technical experts and trainers with a deep understanding of the platform, ensuring that clients&rsquo; training experience is optimised. Projects are structured so that clients’ appointed staff are involved during the whole journey of project execution. This facilitates knowledge transfer and an “on-the-job” training approach and includes specific training sessions that are run before and after solution delivery.</p><h2 id=dashboards-and-reporting>Dashboards and reporting</h2><p>The Kianda platform allows admin users to personalise dashboards based on the unique needs of users or user groups based on hierarchy - for example, only project managers see their forms status and admin users may see the full picture.</p><p>Multiple dashboards can be created and customised as required per project, per department or other configurations. <strong>Access to the dashboards can be set at a high level for the entire dashboard or certain links</strong>, lists or widgets in a dashboard and can be made accessible to certain user groups defined in the system.</p><p><em><strong>Dashboard page</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/IT_dashboard2.jpg alt="Dashboard page"></p><p>Examples of some of our dashboard features include:</p><ul><li>Number of forms awaiting approval</li><li>Number of completed forms per week/period/quarter</li><li>Split dashboards by type or department</li><li>Columns to cater for “requested by”, “date of request”, “pending approval from”, “approved by”, “rejected by”</li><li>An alerts section to highlight approvals that have been pending past X number of days</li><li>Designing layouts to group certain fields</li><li>Charts, Lists, Links, Tiles and Rich Text are available dashboard widgets</li></ul><p>The Kianda platform allows users to report on different forms within a SharePoint site (or other relevant data source), as well as for a particular form library. In addition, the platform allows reporting across multiple form libraries, SharePoint Sites, and SharePoint Site Collections. Our reporting capability goes way beyond reporting from SharePoint data, and allows <strong>combining</strong> of data from multiple data sources for reporting purposes.</p><h3 id=audit-history>Audit history</h3><p>Kianda logs and makes available all security-related events within the Audit History of each record to administrative users. Also, system logs can be made available when required.</p><p>By default, all the forms and processes created in our platform come with <strong>detailed read-only Audit History</strong>. Audit logs are created for any modifications made to records automatically and are only available to configured roles to view. Our platform allows for the set-up of an “auditor role”, with read-only access, to allow an auditor to run reports and check audit logs.</p><p>Admin users can configure optional record level viewing logs. The recording of audit logs is automatic for any changes in the forms which gives detailed field-level auditing information.</p><p>The Kianda Platform integrates with SharePoint which provides IRM (Information Rights Management) features that enable the tagging of certain data or documents not to be printed or emailed and so on.</p><h2 id=support-and-security-updates>Support and security updates</h2><p>Within the Kianda platform, administrative users and general users can report any queries or issues using the <strong>support ticket</strong> menu option available. Our platform is updated with one major release per year and patch/security releases multiple times during the year (which includes security updates). These are communicated with clients in advance.</p><p>We provide multi-levels of data recovery. This includes data version history of records, recycle bin feature and ability to recover from a point in time, backups with a time window of every 10 minutes.</p><p>Our platform supports <strong>99% uptime</strong>. We provide 99% availability; availability is calculated with the exception of scheduled maintenance.</p><p>Our services are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, excluding planned downtime. We expect planned downtime to be infrequent but will endeavour to provide customers with advance notice. If our systems fail, we treat this as a critical high priority event with an impact on our business continuity. We will do everything possible to solve the issue as soon as possible. Our web services use highly available services with <strong>geo-redundancy</strong> enabling a failover to another European region in the event of emergency.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>If you want to use Kianda for no-code development, follow these simple steps:</p><p><img src=/images/one.png alt=1> <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/><strong>Plan your process</strong></a></p><p><img src=/images/two.png alt=2> <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/><strong>Design and build your process</strong></a></p><p><img src=/images/three.png alt=3> <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/publish-your-process/><strong>Publish your process</strong></a></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-e2fd0561e91df0dad0c1df898f3a81bc>1.2 - Logging in to Kianda</h1><p>If your organisation already has a login, go to your given Kianda login page.

The current process may require an employee to email their line manager to request to attend training. The line manager either approves or disapproves the request by returning an email or calling the employee. If the training request is approved, then the line manager emails the training manager stating that the employee will attend training and to schedule this.</p><p><img src=/images/emails.png alt="Email trail"></p><p>Rather than continuing with email trails, with no easy way to see the status of each step and process overall, creating a solution in Kianda will save time, increase efficiencies and therefore reduce costs. In this way, you can become a <strong>citizen developer</strong>, a business professional who uses low-code/no-code tools to solve business needs.</p><h2 id=planning-in-an-agile-way>Planning in an agile way</h2><p>Planning involves 3 considerations: <a href=#planning-your-design><strong>Design</strong></a> , <a href=#planning-interaction><strong>Interaction</strong></a> and <a href=#planning-management><strong>Management</strong></a>. We will now look at each of these areas in turn.</p><p><em><strong>Planning process</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/highlightplan.png alt=Planning></p><p>To plan a solution, you could use Microsoft Office Tools or another preferred program or method to chart out what you need. Each heading will guide through what you need to consider.</p><p>If you already have a process workflow mapped out, you can go straight to <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/>designing and building</a> in Kianda.</p><h2 id=planning-your-design>Planning your design</h2><p>Design considers what a process needs to do and how it might look. Information can be gathered through various methods like Really Round Robin, hackathons and surveys, and captured in product vision boards. Using the 5W&rsquo;s of who, what, when, where and why, along with how, can help map out the necessary information during the project initiation phase.</p><p>In particular, consider what <strong>forms</strong> you need in your process. What kinds of <strong>fields</strong> do you need in order to get the data you seek? What about information you need to provide to form users? Connecting to <strong>datasources</strong> like information in SharePoint, Salesforce or SAP will make your processes dynamic and always up to date.</p><p>In the example of the Training Request process we already discussed, we will need two forms: 1) Training Request form and 2) Training Approval form. The information that we need to capture in each form is listed here, with potential field types in brackets. The information that will be provided to users in each form, for example a SharePoint list for users to scroll through, is also listed.</p><table><thead><tr><th>1) Training Request Form</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Information provided:</strong></td><td>Type of Training (a SharePoint list)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Information needed</strong>:</td><td>Employee Name (textbox)</td><td>Reason for the Request (textbox)</td><td>Line Manager (user picker)</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>2) Training Approval Form</th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Information provided</strong>:</td><td>Name, Reason, Type (group from Request form)</td><td>Line Manager (signature)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Information needed</strong>:</td><td>Decision (a Yes/No radio list)</td><td>Feedback (text box)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you begin to capture the requirements for the process you want to create, it may be useful to refer to the different types of fields available in Kianda - see <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/controls/>Controls</a> for more information on field types.</p><h2 id=planning-interaction>Planning interaction</h2><p>Interaction considers how users will use the process and what series of events might happen to create different desired outputs. Decide on the sequence of events and what <strong>rules</strong> can or need to be applied to create a trigger for the next event in the process.</p><p>In the Training Request process, we&rsquo;ll introduce <strong>Submit</strong> buttons to trigger actions, and a <strong>Rule</strong> so that the form will appear differently based on different user inputs.</p><table><thead><tr><th>1) Training Request Form</th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Actions</strong>:</td><td>Submit (button) allows Employees to submit a form.</td><td>Save (button) to save a draft form.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rule</strong>:</td><td>Send email to a Line Manager when form is submitted.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>2) Training Approval Form</th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Actions</strong>:</td><td>Submit (button) allows Line Managers to submit an approval.</td><td>Save (button) to save a draft.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>The approval appears in a dashboard for the Training Manager.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rule</strong>:</td><td>If Yes is chosen from a radio list, then input signature.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>If No is chosen, then hide the signature and show a Reason text box.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you start to think about what rules you may need to trigger the sequence of events in your process, it may be useful to refer to the different types of rules available in Kianda - see <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/rules/>Rules</a> for more information.</p><h2 id=planning-management>Planning management</h2><p>Next, you need to consider <strong>who will have access</strong> to the information. When designing forms, you can enable elements within a form so that they appear as visible-only or editable.</p><p>You also need to consider who the <strong>form owners</strong> will be, that is, who will have editing access to the forms themselves. This information is needed when you create a process and add forms to it. At this point, you will need to decide what users, or groups will act as form and process administrators. Here, we have outlined the form owners and users for the two forms in our Training Request process example:</p><table><thead><tr><th>1) Training Request Form</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Access</strong>:</td><td>All Employees can access the form.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Owner</strong>:</td><td>Only the Training Manager can edit the form template.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>2) Training Approval Form</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Access</strong>:</td><td>Only Line Managers can access the form.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Owner</strong>:</td><td>Only the Training Manager can edit the form template.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=summary-of-requirements>Summary of requirements</h2><p>Finally, we can summarise all the information we need in a spreadsheet. Field types or controls and rules will become more familiar as you work with Kianda. For now, use this example as a way to get to know what is possible in Kianda.</p><p><em><strong>Examples of Requirements for a Training Request and Approval Process</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/trainingreq_orig.png alt="Training Process requirements"></p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>Now that you know what you need to consider when planning a process, you can go to <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/><strong>design your process</strong></a> to learn how to get started in the Kianda <strong>Designer</strong>.

So at Kianda we always recommend doing some simple planning before you design your first form.</p><p>It could be something as simple as a quick flow chart or as we use a spreadsheet where you quickly log the key components, fields or rules that should be needed in the process.</p><p>In general, we normally include the following key steps to build a process in an agile manner:</p><ol><li>Plan process design, forms, fields, rules, log into design spreadsheet.</li><li>Build forms and fields connecting to data where applicable.</li><li>Publish to dashboards, anonymous forms or SharePoint for end-user distribution.</li></ol><p><em><strong>Platform getting started video</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

Clicking on the <strong>^</strong> quickly uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.</p><p><img src=/images/layout-mode.png alt="Layout mode"></p><p>This allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows designing web interfaces with a mobile-first approach.</p><h2 id=forms--layout-fields>Forms & layout fields</h2><p>Kianda comes with several pre-defined field widgets. In case none of these satisfies your specific needs and if you have some level of <a href=development.md>development</a> skills you can always create your custom field widget.</p><p>At the time of writing, the default fields fall into four main categories of fields:</p><ol><li><strong>Input</strong> - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields.</li><li><strong>Layout</strong> - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields.</li><li><strong>Action</strong> - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components.</li><li><strong>Custom</strong> - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields available under your developer section.</li></ol><p>Layout fields take an important role when building a modern user interface and allow you to achieve the pixel perfect layout you want.</p><h3 id=model-dialogs>Model dialogs</h3><p>Model dialogs are a special form of layout fields. It allows a form designer to define an interface with the key intention of grabbing users attention to something important.</p><p>Typically we use dialogs for things like requiring user confirmation or to let them make a final decision.</p><p><em><strong>How to use a model dialog</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src="/videos/How to use a model dialog.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><p>On the example above, we use a modal dialog to display a simple <em>warning to the user</em>. The following are the steps:</p><ol><li>On the Layout components, select the <em>Dialog</em>.</li><li>Click on the dialog component to insert other fields within it.</li><li>You can add any field to your dialog, in this case, we are adding a Rich text.</li><li>To preview how your dialog box will be displayed, you can use the <strong>Preview</strong> button, on the dialog component.</li></ol><h3 id=forms>Forms</h3><p>Forms are an important component of any process, they might be used as stages of a process and could be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).</p><p>The key rules for working with forms are:</p><ol><li>Forms are assignable - means that only a form assignee can edit a particular form. This can be a combination of users and groups.</li><li>Only form owners can edit a given form by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</li><li>Multi-step processes use the concept of &ldquo;current form&rdquo;. Only the form matching the process status will be made editable.</li><li>In a multi-step process, other forms that are not &ldquo;current form&rdquo; can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form. Meaning they might also be editable and will form a form group.</li></ol><p>The rules above work together to determine if the form is in edit mode or display mode. Form designers have at their disposal <a href=business-rules.md>business rules</a> such as <em>assign form</em>, <em>go to form</em> and <em>submit rule</em> to dynamically control the ability for end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.</p><p><em><strong>How to add new form</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result back to the person that started the submission.</p><p>We have seen a few examples of how people use anonymous forms in Kianda. From simple feedback forms to GDPR data requests that hope between multi divisions before sending back a response to the requester with the level of information held by the organization.</p><p>Anonymous forms can be embedded in iframes and safely displayed within other web-based applications.</p><p>In Kianda there are effectively 2 types of anonymous forms</p><ul><li>New process anonymous form</li><li>Existing process anonymous form</li></ul><h3 id=new-instance-anonymous-form-url>New instance anonymous form URL</h3><p>To set up a globally available link for allowing external users to create a new instance, perform the following steps within the form designer:</p><ol><li>On the top right corner of the designer click on the settings button.</li><li>Then click the option &ldquo;Enable anonymous sharing of forms&rdquo; to Yes.</li><li>Click the button &ldquo;New Link&rdquo; to generate a new anonymous link.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/anonymous-forms.png alt="Anonymous Form Settings"></p><h3 id=existing-instance-anonymous-form-url>Existing instance anonymous form URL</h3><p>To setup existing instance anonymous form one needs to use the anonymous form rule to generate a new anonymous link at the runtime that will point to an existing process record that can then be shared with external users.</p><p>Note that for this to work steps 1 and 2 of New Instance Anonymous form is still required.</p><p>The following are some of the key options of the anonymous link rule:</p><ul><li>Form to share (any form within an existing process).</li><li>Link expires settings: Number of uses, time-based or never expire.</li><li>Message to display on submission.</li></ul><p><strong>Important</strong>: There can be only one active link of each type for a given process. Once a new anonymous link is created for a process it will automatically expire the previous of the same type if a link existed.</p><h2 id=input-fields>Input fields</h2><p>Kianda forms usability is brought to life with the help of the various input fields available that are specifically adapted to work in mobile, tablet or desktop modes.</p><p>From the textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table, Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be adjusted to work with a myriad of scenarios.</p><p>Key properties of fields:</p><p>Each field comes with its own set of settings like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input.</p><p>The following are some of the common settings of input fields:</p><ul><li>Title - Every field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user.</li><li>Required - This Boolean property allows making a field mandatory or not.</li><li>Visible - Displays the field in the form or not.</li><li>Layout - Defines both desktop or mobile layout.</li></ul><h3 id=cascading-dropdown>Cascading dropdown</h3><p>The List field provides the opportunity to define an unlimited level cascading dropdown hierarchy very easily.</p><p>To achieve that you might connect your list to a data source table or SharePoint list then use the list data source conditions options to filter its content based on a parent list.</p><p><img src=/images/cascading-dropdown.png alt="Cascading dropdown"></p><p><em><strong>How to create cascading dropdowns</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

Simply enable the <strong>required</strong> flag of an input field and it will automatically prevent users from submitting it empty.</p><p>The required flag will conveniently be ignored in case the field is not visible, this will allow you to configure conditionally mandatory fields.</p><p>Another way of validating input is to use the <strong>validate input rule</strong> this allows greater flexibility in terms of when or what to validate.</p><h2 id=cloning>Cloning</h2><p>In the form designer, almost any of the components can be cloned.

It is particularly useful in those situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.</p><p>Custom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. If you need to build &ldquo;an action&rdquo; then you should use a custom rule widget.</p><p>It allows a developer to build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes.</p><p>Check-out the <a href=development.md>development</a> section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.</p><h2 id=advanced-techniques>Advanced techniques</h2><p>Like the cascading dropdown discussed above, several other advanced scenarios can be easily configured in Kianda. Here is a short-list:</p><ul><li><strong>Repeating section</strong> - A repeating section can be created by adding a <strong>panel</strong> to a table field. This table can be configured to include a single column made of the panel that itself will include the repeating fields of your repeating section.</li><li><strong>The capture of media</strong> - Kianda enables mobile users to directly capture pictures, video or audio just like a native application.</li><li><strong>Background save</strong> - By making use of PWA principles (Progressive Web Application) Kianda allows the ability to perform background operations. This is useful when, for example, a mobile user picks-up their phone to perform a quick action and places it back in his pocket. Operations will continue in the background allowing all data to be captured.</li><li><strong>Image annotation</strong> - Kianda allows for image annotation online or offline.</li><li><strong>Multi-column / row layout</strong> - Making multi-column responsive interfaces is quite easy. Simply add two panels into a form that only use half of the screen (6 columns) then add fields inside panels and you have multiple column layouts. Adding a panel using 12 columns gives you a row.</li><li><strong>Form tab colour and icon</strong> - Form tabs can be quickly customised to display their icons or tab colours, it is also possible to define custom colours for selected and completed form tabs.</li><li><strong>Hide form tab and left nav</strong> - This is self-explanatory, yes you can hide the default navigation elements.</li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-2f4258c04d1e2f0a31f1e90e21271791>2.2.1 - Designer</h1><p>Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> provides an intuitive interface where you can quickly start building <strong>forms</strong> for any business use case.

<source src=/videos/designerintro.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><p>There are 3 key principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ol><li>Form <strong>design</strong> - what a form looks like, what elements it contains, for example controls and rules</li><li>Form <strong>interaction</strong> - how users can use forms depending on certain sequences happening</li><li>Form <strong>management</strong> - who can edit and access forms</li></ol><p>This page presents the information you need related to form design, that is what a form looks like, and what it contains. By default, form designers can edit forms, but they can also set how other people interact with forms, for example to make forms viewable as <strong>read-only</strong>. Go to <a href=platform/form_management.md>Form management</a> to find out more about how form ownership works, and <a href=platform/form_interaction.md>Form interaction</a> to find out how a complete process flow works once forms are designed and assigned.

Forms contain all the buttons, fields, and rule triggers needed to execute your process.</p><p>There are three principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ul><li><strong>Reading modes</strong>: <strong>Form users</strong> can either use forms in <strong>edit</strong> mode or <strong>read</strong> mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review feedback in a form, but not be able to edit/update it. See <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/rules/><strong>Rules</strong></a> for more information on different types of rules.</li><li><strong>Form owner</strong>: The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to <strong>when the the form is created</strong>. By default, only this person or group <strong>can edit the form</strong>. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups.</li><li><strong>Current form</strong>: Typically there are several forms in a process, and only the form that has the status ‘<strong>current form’</strong> is editable. However, in a complex multi-step process, other forms can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form, meaning they can also become editable at the same time, creating a form group.</li></ul><p>These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below. These properties can also change <strong>dynamically</strong> as a result of <strong>rules being applied</strong>. See <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/rules/><strong>Rules</strong></a> for more information on different types of rules.</p><p><em><strong>New form dialog box</strong></em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/newformsegments-1.gif alt=img></p><h5 id=new-form-considerations>New form considerations</h5><ol><li>The <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field is where you can set individuals and groups as the default <strong>form owners</strong> who can edit the form.</li><li><strong>Activate with</strong> means that the form can be activated with other forms within the process, so they can be edited at the same time. This means several forms become the <strong>current form</strong> in a form group.</li><li><strong>Submit mode</strong> means that when a process instance is running you can choose <strong>only this form</strong> to be submitted, or you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong> meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved.</li><li><strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable a) reassignment, b) edit, and c) custom actions on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means the user(s) assigns the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</li></ol></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-ef48b6171c7c6a9791bf53a2c8638848>2.2.2.1 - Form owners</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>When creating forms, is important to consider <strong>form access</strong> during the design phase, that is who can access and edit forms in a process instance. For example if an employee submits a performance review form, a line manager may wish to access that submitted process instance/record and edit the form, adding in comments and performance grades.</p><p>There are two key principles to keep in mind in terms of <strong>form access</strong>:</p><ol><li>Forms are <strong>assignable</strong> - this means that only a form assignee, that is, someone that is assigned to a form, can <strong>edit</strong> a particular form in a process instance. The &lsquo;assignee&rsquo; can be a combination of users and groups.</li><li><strong>Only form owners</strong> can edit a given form by <strong>default</strong>. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</li></ol><p>So what is <strong>form owner</strong>? A form owner can be assigned when a form is created in Kianda Designer. Only the form owner will be able to edit <strong>process instances</strong> (records).</p><p>Once a process has been designed and users can initiate new process instances or records from a dashboard page, then the only people who can edit process records are the form owners or someone who has had the record assigned to them.
For example, a line manager who is a form owner may need to add additional information about work goals to an appraisal form their employee has already filled out.</p><h3 id=getting-started-with-form-owners>Getting started with Form owners</h3><p>To create form owners:</p><ol><li>Click on a process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on an existing process or create a new process by clicking on <strong>Add new</strong> and complete the <strong>Add new process</strong> dialog box.</li><li>Then within Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> click on a form of interest and then click on the <strong>Edit</strong>/{Pen} <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit/Pen button">button for that form.</li><li>In the <strong>Edit form</strong> dialog box you can add form owners in the <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field - this can be <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> or <strong>Partners</strong>.</li></ol><p>The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to <strong>when the the form is created</strong>. By default, only this person or group <strong>can edit the form</strong>. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups.</p><p>The rules above work together to determine if the form is in <strong>edit mode</strong> or <strong>display mode</strong>. Form designers have at their disposal <a href=business-rules.md>business rules</a> such as <em>assign form</em>, <em>go to form</em> and <em>submit rule</em> to dynamically control the ability for end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-f2ca3086a88c04d95af05e5755cb758d>2.2.2.2 - Form display modes</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-91e87a061202a15b4442671707316f31>2.2.2.3 - Form quick actions menu</h1><p><strong>Form quick action</strong> menu will appear to designated users as a quick action menu option in the top right-hand corner of a form.</p><p>Depending on what type of quick actions are enabled and if you are assigned quick actions as a form user,, then you will see options when you click on the <strong>quick action</strong> button <img src=/images/quick-action-button.jpg alt="Quick action menu">, for example to reassign a form to someone else, or to perform a custom action like signing off on a purchase order.</p><p><img src=/images/quick-action-view.jpg alt="Quick action menu"></p><h3 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h3><p>To enable quick actions, click on a process with Kianda Designer and then a form of choice so that the <strong>Edit</strong> (Pen) icon is visible.</p><ol><li><p>Click on the <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit pen icon"> to edit a form.</p></li><li><p>In the <strong>Edit form</strong> dialog box, check the checkbox beside <strong>Enable quick actions</strong>.</p></li><li><p>When you select <strong>Enable quick actions</strong> then you have three options to select:</p><ul><li><strong>Enable re-assign</strong> - allows a form in a process instance to be reassigned to a by a designated person/group</li><li><strong>Enable edit</strong> - allows a form in a process instance to be edited by a designated person/group</li><li><strong>Enable custom action</strong> - allows a form in a process instance to have customised actions associated with it, and these actions are assigned to a designated person/group</li></ul><p><img src=/images/setting-quick-actions.jpg alt="Quick action menu"></p><p>Check the checkbox beside the desired action as necessary.</p></li><li><p>When you check a checkbox for example <strong>Enable edit</strong> then you can click on the <strong>Ellipsis</strong> button <img src=/images/ellipsis-frame alt="Ellipsis button"> to assign users to the quick action.

Processes can connect to your data sources like Sharepoint or SalesForce allowing for the flexibility of your applications to grow as your business grows.</p><p>Each process can be linked to <strong>dashboards</strong> so you can see at a glance, for example, how many leave requests were submitted, purchase orders approved and so on. And you can customise all of these processes the way you want.</p><p>Before you begin, we at Kianda recommend doing some simple planning before you design your process.

When you click on the <strong>Destination</strong> button, a <strong>Select datasource</strong> dialog box opens in which you can choose where to save the file(s):</p><p><img src=/images/file-upload-datasource.jpg alt="Select datasource dialog box"></p><p>You can choose to save the file or files to Kianda or to another external data source.</p></li><li><p><strong>Open file behaviour</strong>: You can choose whether the file is downloaded or opens in an internet browser.</p></li><li><p><strong>Folder structure</strong>: If you have chosen an external data source as the &lsquo;Save location&rsquo; for the file(s) uploaded to the file upload field, you can then choose the folder structure you want to use for saving the files to that external data source.</p></li><li><p><strong>Allow file override</strong>: You can choose whether or not to allow file override. If you choose &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;, if a user goes back into the form and uploads another file to the File upload field, this will override the original file they had uploaded. This option works in conjunction with the <strong>Allow uploading multiple files</strong> option - if you choose to allow multiple files to be uploaded, then the &lsquo;Allow file override&rsquo; option is no longer relevant (as uploading more files will not override file/files already uploaded).</p></li><li><p><strong>Allow remove file</strong>: If you select <strong>Yes</strong>, this allows the form user to come back into the form and remove the file they had previously uploaded, and another option appears - <strong>Remove and delete file</strong>: if you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, when the file is removed, it will also be deleted from the location where it was stored; if you choose <strong>No</strong>, then only the reference to the file is removed from the form.</p></li><li><p><strong>Allow uploading multiple files</strong>: Choose <strong>No</strong> to only allow the user to upload one file or choose <strong>Yes</strong> to allow the user to upload multiple files.</p></li><li><p><strong>File name options</strong>: Choose whether to keep the original file name, to have the file name auto generated by the system, or to be based on a form field. If you choose <strong>From form field</strong>, another option appears - <strong>File name field</strong> - and you click in the blank field to choose the file name field you want the file name to be:</p><p><img src=/images/file-name-field.jpg alt="File name field"></p></li><li><p><strong>File extension</strong>: You can set/limit the type of file(s) that can be uploaded by inserting a specific file type. For example, if you insert <strong>.pdf</strong> in the File extension box, when the user browses for the file to attach, the file type will automatically be set to .pdf. If you want to allow any type of file to be attached, leave this option blank.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enable media capture</strong>: If you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, this enables the user to capture media to upload - on a mobile device, when the user clicks on the Upload button their camera/video recorder will open (depending on whether you&rsquo;ve selected the file extension to be image or video).</p></li><li><p><strong>Button text</strong>: By default, the File upload icon has the text <strong>Browse</strong>, but you can change this here.</p></li><li><p><strong>Button icon</strong>: By default, the file upload icon is <img src=/images/file-upload-icon.jpg alt="File upload icon"> but you can change this by clicking the Button icon drop-down menu and choosing a different icon from the large range of icons available.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enable background upload</strong>: Select this checkbox to enable files to be uploaded using a background operation. This option is typically used in conjunction with the <strong>Enable chunked upload</strong> option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enable chunked upload</strong>: Select this checkbox to upload files using resumable chunks. This option can be useful if the file size is likely to be large or the network speed is likely to be slow.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you select <strong>Enable background upload</strong> and <strong>Enable chunked upload</strong> there is an additional step you need to take to ensure that these upload options work. In your form, you need to select <u>each field or button</u> that has a <strong>Save process rule</strong> applied to it, click on that rule to open the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box and select the <strong>Perform background save</strong> checkbox. Then click <strong>OK</strong>. This will ensure that the upload options you&rsquo;ve chosen for your File upload field work as intended.</p><p>For example, you would need to select the &lsquo;Save process&rsquo; rule attached to the &lsquo;Save&rsquo;

If the manager select&rsquo;s to approve the training, a sign-off button then appears; if the manager reject&rsquo;s the request, a &lsquo;Reason&rsquo; text box appears for them to insert their feedback.

Often, rules are applied to buttons so that actions are automatically executed once the user clicks on the button. To learn more about rules, go to <a href=/docs/platform/rules/>Rules</a>.</p><p>For example, as part of an Employee Appraisal Process, a manager may complete a Performance Plan form for each employee, setting out their Key Performance Areas and goals. It could be useful to add a button to this form - titled &lsquo;Schedule Meeting&rsquo; - that will automatically schedule a performance review meeting between the manager and the employee at a pre-determined date in the future.

This is important if there are <strong>multiple rules</strong> attached to an item like a button. In this case the order of execution is important and can be modified to suit your needs.</p><p>For example, you may want a <strong>Send email rule</strong> to be executed once the <strong>Submit</strong> button is clicked. This will result in an automated email to a designated person. You may also want to attach a report to this email, a report that is a complete form. In this example a <strong>Generate word</strong> <strong>document</strong> <strong>rule</strong> could be used to generate a report when the <strong>Submit</strong> button is clicked. In this example the <strong>Generate word document rule</strong> has to be executed before the <strong>Send email rule</strong>, so that the Word document can be generated and then attached to the email.</p><p>The rule order consideration is therefore particularly important when rules are dependent on each other - where the output of one rule is the input of another rule.</p><h3 id=changing-the-rule-order-of-multiple-rules>Changing the rule order of multiple rules</h3><p>In the example below we will look at changing the rule order of a Send email rule attached to a Submit button. The <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> buttons by default already have <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> process rules attached, in order to allow form shutdown.</p><p>To change rule order, when the rule is created:</p><ol><li>Click on the item that has multiple rules attached, for example a <strong>Submit</strong> button.</li><li>Click on <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, drag the <strong>Send email</strong> rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and drag it to the top of the list, before <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> rules.</li></ol><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ruleorder_frame.png alt=img></p><p>The video below shows an example of a <strong>Send email rule</strong> being created and saved. The rule is attached to the <strong>Submit</strong> button. Once the rule is created, by default the new rule goes to the bottom of the list of rules. To move the rule, simply click on it and drag it to where you wish to place it. In this example we want the email sent <u>before</u> any of the shutdown processes like Submit or Save, but after a <strong>Generate Inspection</strong> rule, so the output from that rule can be used in the Send email rule.</p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

It enables developers and non-developers (citizen developers) to build ambitious web based business applications of any kind.</p><p>In this documentation you will find the information that will let you build beautiful mobile-ready web applications or simple forms that orchestrate into a functional digital business process using the Kianda low-code and no-code approach.</p><p>In summary the Kianda platform provides an ideal interface for rapid prototyping and delivering outcomes quickly. Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> is the main interface for designing processes. Designer components are explained below.</p><h3 id=how-to-get-started-with-kianda-designer>How to get started with Kianda Designer</h3><p>The key components of the form designer are:</p><ol><li>Left panel</li><li>The central area is where the current <strong>form canvas</strong> is displayed.</li><li>The right panel is where the currently selected component <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>rules</strong> are displayed.</li></ol><p><em><strong>Form designer key components</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/form-designer.png alt="Form designer components"></p><h2 id=responsive-form-layout>Responsive form layout</h2><p>Form fields are made to with a mobile-first approach giving you design once and deploy everywhere opportunity.</p><p>By using the <strong>Layout</strong> option under the property panel you will be able to simply define the layout of your fields or panels within a form. Clicking on the <strong>^</strong> quickly uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.</p><p><img src=/images/layout-mode.png alt="Layout mode"></p><p>This allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows designing web interfaces with a mobile-first approach.</p><h2 id=forms--layout-fields>Forms & layout fields</h2><p>Kianda comes with several pre-defined field widgets. In case none of them satisfies your specific needs and if you have some level of <a href=development.md>development</a> skills you can always create your custom field widget.</p><p>At the time of writing, the default fields fall into four main categories of fields:</p><ol><li><strong>Input</strong> - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields.</li><li><strong>Layout</strong> - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields.</li><li><strong>Action</strong> - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components.</li><li><strong>Custom</strong> - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields available under your developer section.</li></ol><p>Layout fields take an important role when building a modern user interface and allow you to achieve the pixel perfect layout you want.</p><h3 id=model-dialogs>Model dialogs</h3><p>Model dialogs are a special form of layout fields. It allows a form designer to define an interface with the key intention of grabbing users attention to something important.</p><p>Typically we use dialogs for things like requiring user confirmation or to let them make a final decision.</p><p><em><strong>How to use a model dialog</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src="/videos/How to use a model dialog.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><p>On the example above, we use a modal dialog to display a simple <em>warning to the user</em>. The following are the steps:</p><ol><li>On the Layout components, select the <em>Dialog</em>.</li><li>Click on the dialog component to insert other fields within it.</li><li>You can add any field to your dialog, in this case, we are adding a Rich text.</li><li>To preview how your dialog box will be displayed, you can use the <strong>Preview</strong> button, on the dialog component.</li></ol><h3 id=forms>Forms</h3><p>Forms are an important component of any process, they might be used as stages of a process and could be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).</p><p>The key rules for working with forms are:</p><ol><li>Forms are assignable - means that only a form assignee can edit a particular form. This can be a combination of users and groups.</li><li>Only form owners can edit a given form by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</li><li>Multi-step processes use the concept of &ldquo;current form&rdquo;. Only the form matching the process status will be made editable.</li><li>In a multi-step process, other forms that are not &ldquo;current form&rdquo; can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form. Meaning they might also be editable and will form a form group.</li></ol><p>The rules above work together to determine if the form is in edit mode or display mode. Form designers have at their disposal <a href=business-rules.md>business rules</a> such as <em>assign form</em>, <em>go to form</em> and <em>submit rule</em> to dynamically control the ability for end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.</p><p><em><strong>How to add new form</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result back to the person that started the submission.</p><p>We have seen a few examples of how people use anonymous forms in Kianda. From simple feedback forms to GDPR data requests that hope between multi divisions before sending back a response to the requester with the level of information held by the organization.</p><p>Anonymous forms can be embedded in iframes and safely displayed within other web-based applications.</p><p>In Kianda there are effectively 2 types of anonymous forms</p><ul><li>New process anonymous form</li><li>Existing process anonymous form</li></ul><h3 id=new-instance-anonymous-form-url>New instance anonymous form URL</h3><p>To set up a globally available link for allowing external users to create a new instance, perform the following steps within the form designer:</p><ol><li>On the top right corner of the designer click on the settings button.</li><li>Then click the option &ldquo;Enable anonymous sharing of forms&rdquo; to Yes.</li><li>Click the button &ldquo;New Link&rdquo; to generate a new anonymous link.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/anonymous-forms.png alt="Anonymous Form Setting"></p><h3 id=existing-instance-anonymous-form-url>Existing instance anonymous form URL</h3><p>To setup existing instance anonymous form one needs to use the anonymous form rule to generate a new anonymous link at the runtime that will point to an existing process record that can then be shared with external users.</p><p>Note that for this to work steps 1 and 2 of New Instance Anonymous form is still required.</p><p>The following are some of the key options of the anonymous link rule:</p><ul><li>Form to share (any form within an existing process).</li><li>Link expires settings: Number of uses, time-based or never expire.</li><li>Message to display on submission.</li></ul><p><strong>Important</strong>: There can be only one active link of each type for a given process. Once a new anonymous link is created for a process it will automatically expire the previous of the same type if a link existed.</p><h2 id=input-fields>Input fields</h2><p>Kianda forms usability is brought to life with the help of the various input fields available that are specifically adapted to work in mobile, tablet or desktop modes.</p><p>From the textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table, Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be adjusted to work with a myriad of scenarios.</p><p>Key properties of fields:</p><p>Each field comes with its own set of settings like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input.</p><p>The following are some of the common settings of input fields:</p><ul><li>Title - Every field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user.</li><li>Required - This Boolean property allows making a field mandatory or not.</li><li>Visible - Displays the field in the form or not.</li><li>Layout - Defines both desktop or mobile layout.</li></ul><h3 id=cascading-dropdown>Cascading dropdown</h3><p>The List field provides the opportunity to define an unlimited level cascading dropdown hierarchy very easily.</p><p>To achieve that you might connect your list to a data source table or SharePoint list then use the list data source conditions options to filter its content based on a parent list.</p><p><img src=/images/cascading-dropdown.png alt="Cascading dropdown"></p><p><em><strong>How to create cascading dropdowns</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

Simply enable the <strong>required</strong> flag of an input field and it will automatically prevent users from submitting it empty.</p><p>The required flag will conveniently be ignored in case the field is not visible, this will allow you to configure conditionally mandatory fields.</p><p>Another way of validating input is to use the <strong>validate input rule</strong> this allows greater flexibility in terms of when or what to validate.</p><h2 id=cloning>Cloning</h2><p>In the form designer, almost any of the components can be cloned. This will increase your productivity considerably and will make creating multi-step processes a breeze.</p><p>To clone either a field a panel or even a form simple select the component then click the clone button in the properties panel in the right-hand side of the panel.</p><p>If cloning a field the cloning dialog will prompt for the destination of the new cloned field, once your choice is made, simply click ok.</p><p><em><strong>Cloning a form</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

It is particularly useful in those situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.</p><p>Custom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. If you need to build &ldquo;an action&rdquo; then you should use a custom rule widget.</p><p>It allows a developer to build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes.</p><p>Check-out the <a href=development.md>development</a> section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.</p><h2 id=advanced-techniques>Advanced techniques</h2><p>Like the cascading dropdown discussed above, several other advanced scenarios can be easily configured in Kianda. Here is a short-list:</p><ul><li><strong>Repeating section</strong> - A repeating section can be created by adding a <strong>panel</strong> to a table field. This table can be configured to include a single column made of the panel that itself will include the repeating fields of your repeating section.</li><li><strong>The capture of media</strong> - Kianda enables mobile users to directly capture pictures, video or audio just like a native application.</li><li><strong>Background save</strong> - By making use of PWA principles (Progressive Web Application) Kianda allows the ability to perform background operations. This is useful when, for example, a mobile user picks-up their phone to perform a quick action and places it back in his pocket. Operations will continue in the background allowing all data to be captured.</li><li><strong>Image annotation</strong> - Kianda allows for image annotation online or offline.</li><li><strong>Multi-column / row layout</strong> - Making multi-column responsive interfaces is quite easy. Simply add two panels into a form that only use half of the screen (6 columns) then add fields inside panels and you have multiple column layouts. Adding a panel using 12 columns gives you a row.</li><li><strong>Form tab colour and icon</strong> - Form tabs can be quickly customised to display their icons or tab colours, it is also possible to define custom colours for selected and completed form tabs.</li><li><strong>Hide form tab and left nav</strong> - This is self-explanatory, yes you can hide the default navigation elements.</li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-e04b3662f527b448bdc4fbb13e8601a3>3.1 - Application layout</h1><p><em>As a driver of agile software development</em></p><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-d754f0bea6a937c812d8282e2ec155e1>3.2 - Configuration over customisation principle</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-8977ed83d537d9bc8cea70e1acc7de75>3.3 - Implementing dynamic logic with rules</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-aab0831564a6ffa72db0b9ba9960eb48>3.4 - No-Code application development life cycle</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-1b4d84bdfa59cae8718b1a398e13f3ba>3.5 - No-code design principles</h1><h2 id=getting-started-with-the-kianda-platform>Getting started with the Kianda platform</h2><p>The Kianda platform no-code / low-code (NCLC) platform is built with the ultimate flexibility and agility in mind.</p><p>At the software level Kianda follows an <strong>MVC approach</strong> (Model, View, Controller). This approach enabled the Kianda team to build a flexible way for designers to build mobile responsive applications by using <strong>rapid UI prototyping</strong> via drag & drop of forms and fields. This layout serves as the basis for defining the application or process schema and for capturing and reporting on data at run-time.</p><p>Some of the underlying technologies used within the platform include CSS3, HTML5, EmberJS, WebApi and NodeJS.</p><p>Using a MVC approach allows that data, captured within forms and fields, to instantly react or trigger declarative rules defined on fields, forms or at process level via the <strong>rules engine</strong>. This combined with conditional logic is used by designers to build ambitious progressive web applications or end-to-end digital business processes that offer both a great UI and high performance.</p><p><img src=/images/platform-areas.png alt="Platform areas"></p><blockquote><p>In Kianda one of the most important components that is worth emphasis is the <a href=/rules/><strong>rules engine</strong>.</a></p></blockquote><h3 id=in-a-nutshell-the-rules-engine-is-made-of>In a nutshell the <strong>rules-engine</strong> is made of:</h3><ol><li>Rule blocks - These are blocks that unlocks specific functionality using a toolkit approach</li><li>Flexible and declarative conditional logic</li></ol><p>These two components (rule blocks and conditional logic) are used extensively and recursively by designers to build the required orchestration of actions or rules that react of interact with data to provide the required functionality for your apps or processes.</p><p>In summary the Kianda platform provides an ideal interface for rapid prototyping and delivering outcomes quickly.</p><blockquote><h3 id=what-makes-kianda-great-is-the-simplicity-and-unbounded-flexibility-it-gives-citizen-developers-and-low-code-developers-alike>What makes Kianda great is the simplicity and unbounded flexibility it gives citizen developers and low-code developers alike</h3></blockquote><h3 id=table-of-contents>Table of contents</h3></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-4b4fe97efad5b595d35ef5d0b11f72a5>3.6 - No-Code Development Best Practices</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-529ab877bc340518d76c7b8617ea6132>3.7 - Process design vs instances</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-3382dba2deef6c64f63b9031834703f8>3.8 - Why choose no-code?</h1><p>Covering from document generation to task automation following industry best practices, the Kianda platform can deliver quickly amazing results to any digital project.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-0f5a3f5a02977986654eeb13c2532203>4 - What is Low-Code Development?</h1><p>Kianda comes with several pre-defined field, rule and dashboard widgets. In case you want to create something else to satisfy your specific needs you can create your own custom widget if you have some level of development skills. Kianda uses EmberJS to build modern web applications, and in particular the Handlebars templating library to power the application&rsquo;s user interface.</p><h2 id=emberjs-templating-basics>EmberJS templating basics</h2><p>With Handlebars you can quickly build web applications that are made up of different components. Handlebar templates contain static HTML and dynamic content inside Handlebars expressions, which are summoned with double curly braces: {{ }}</p><p>Dynamic content inside a Handlebars expression is rendered with data-binding. This means if you update a property, your usage of that property in a template will be automatically updated to the latest value.</p><h3 id=helpers>Helpers</h3><p>Ember gives the ability to write your helpers, to bring a minimum of logic into Ember templating. For example, let&rsquo;s say you would like the ability to add a few numbers together, without needing to define a computed property everywhere you would like to do so.</p><p><em><strong>Helper example</strong></em><img src=/images/write-our-own-helpers.png alt=Helpers></p><h4 id=conditionals>Conditionals</h4><p>Statements like <strong>if</strong> and <strong>unless</strong> are implemented as built-in helpers. Helpers can be invoked three ways; inline invocation, nested invocation and block invocation.

This means with Kianda you get a digital experience that is native-like while maintaining online web benefits.</p><blockquote><p><em>Access your digital workspace PWA by going to https://&lt;businessName>.kianda.com</em></p></blockquote><p>There are several benefits of using a PWA app when comparing to a web app or even a native only app.</p><ul><li><strong>Reliable</strong> - Apps keep working with or without network access. Even when your users are going through a tunnel or in a lift, changes are automatically queued offline and then synchronised when connectivity is restored.</li><li><strong>Fast</strong> - App loads quickly thanks to having the app installed locally, app resources are available offline.</li><li><strong>Engaging</strong> - When installing on your home screen with your brand icons users receive timely push notifications that help them stay engaged.</li></ul><h2 id=installing-your-pwa-on-a-mobile>Installing your PWA on a mobile</h2><p>There are a few options to install your Kianda PWA workspace into mobile devices. The quickest is to let your users manually use the option &ldquo;Add to home screen&rdquo; in their mobile devices.</p><h3 id=android>Android</h3><p>Android users are automatically prompted to install the PWA when they navigate to your digital workspace URL. Then can quickly choose to install by clicking the install banner prompt.</p><p>Optionally users can manually install it by following the steps:</p><ol><li>Navigate to https://&lt;businessName>.kianda.com.</li><li>Click<img src=images/android-nav.png alt=1567866702202>then tap on &ldquo;Add to Home screen&rdquo;.</li><li>On the confirm dialog tap &ldquo;Add&rdquo;.</li></ol><h3 id=ios>iOS</h3><p>iOS users are not yet automatically prompted to install PWA&rsquo;s but it is something that can also very quickly be done by iOS users.</p><ol><li>Navigate to https://&lt;businessName>.kianda.com.</li><li>Tap the action button<img src=images/ios-action.png alt=1567867653481>then tap &ldquo;Add to Home screen&rdquo;.</li><li>On the &ldquo;Add to Home Screen&rdquo; tap &ldquo;Add&rdquo;.</li></ol><h2 id=offline-or-online>Offline or online</h2><p>As we know in some cases, when there is no internet connection, websites are completely constrained to be shown appropriately. On the other hand, progressive web applications are regularly independent, enabling users to browse the app when not online, this increases engagement and availability greatly. With an offline mode, any information can be saved automatically during the last online access.</p><p>Emphasize benefits to potential clients who are frequently operating in remote areas with no access to the internet.</p><h2 id=performance>Performance</h2><p>Progressive web apps are faster because of the way the underlying technology caches and serves text, stylesheets, images and other content on the websites. As a result user experience, consistency and conversion rate increase.</p><p>Progressive web apps utilize service workers, which are JavaScript files that run independently from the main browser thread and efficiently control caching, this is how progressive web apps enhance better performance than traditional web apps.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-944a216de0dbca20c8471c4a6eeb8ba0>4.3 - Why choose low-code development?</h1></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-ef5ddc6db3af636700a99f52da9d51e6>4.4 - Templating basics</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-a038fae1b78d50ba21200563cbfbfe96>4.5 - Low-code customisation options for the list widget</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-d7e93db56b50d35848a8aceb3c45ac29>4.6 - Javascript expressions</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-a7699f02225f7b50346d9e12f3e8ee24>4.7 - Global CSS file</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-459f0f703cd9eff35aed5f1b8f5b5bcb>4.8 - Global JavaScript file</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-0cff4838e529d39c7c9d6574ac33fb9d>4.9 - Custom form control development</h1></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-65604b2f6851b45208280ce6de9e51b7>4.10 - Custom rule widget development</h1></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-5a69a2ca69d3395dc200dd35ac4b4818>4.11 - Custom dashboard widget development</h1></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-becdf0208cd869f49b3dafe1e6d773d0>4.12 - Low-Code development best practices</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-3ed42a366033a73c16952def2baeb723>5 - How to videos</h1></div><div class=td-content><h1 id=pg-b1f58797307eb8d259563bc5fae8d020>5.1 - Adding rules to a process</h1><div class=lead>Learn how to add a rule into a process in Kianda</div><p>This video introduces Kianda rules and demonstrates how to add a Send email Communications rule to a form.</p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
