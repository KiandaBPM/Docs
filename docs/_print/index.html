<source src=/videos/designerintro.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=predefined-fields>Predefined fields</h2><p>Kianda comes with 16 predefined field widgets, see <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/add-controls-and-rules/>Controls</a> for a full list. You can also use <a href=/docs/getting-started/welcome/low-code/>Kianda Developer</a> to create custom fields if you have some development experience and none of the predefined field widgets satisfy your specific needs.</p><p>The default fields fall into four main categories:</p><ol><li><strong>Input</strong> - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields.</li><li><strong>Layout</strong> - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields.</li><li><strong>Action</strong> - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components.</li><li><strong>Custom</strong> - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields developed using <a href=/docs/getting-started/welcome/low-code/>Kianda Developer</a>.</li></ol><p>For example, layout fields play an important role when building a modern user interface as they allow you to add <strong>Richtext</strong> and <strong>Dialog boxes</strong>. You can use these fields together to create a modal dialog, allowing you as the form designer to create an alert for a form user - for example, when requiring user confirmation or making a final decision or check.</p><p><em><strong>Example of fields in action - creating a modal dialog</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src=/videos/modaldialog.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=responsive-form-layout>Responsive form layout</h2><p>Form fields are made to with a mobile-first approach, giving you design once and deploy everywhere opportunity.</p><p>By using the <strong>Layout</strong> option in the property panel, you will be able to simply define the layout of your fields or panels within a form. Clicking on the <strong>Collapse or expand</strong> <img src=/images/collapse.PNG alt="Collapse or expand"> button quickly uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.</p><p><img src=/images/layout.png alt="Layout mode"></p><p>This allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows you to design web interfaces with a mobile-first approach. You can see this layout in action in this video.</p><p><em><strong>Editing forms</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src=/videos/editfields_inuse.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=properties-and-settings>Properties and settings</h2><p>Kianda form usability is brought to life with the help of the various input fields that are specifically adapted to work in mobile, tablet or desktop modes.</p><p>For each type of input field - such as textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table - Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be <strong>adjusted</strong> through properties and settings to work with a myriad of scenarios.</p><p>Each field comes with its own range of settings like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input.</p><p>These are some of the common properties of input fields:</p><ul><li>Title - Each field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user.</li><li>Required - Using this checkbox makes a field mandatory for form users to fill in.</li><li>Visible - Displays the field in the form if checked.</li><li>Layout - Defines both desktop or mobile layout.</li></ul><p>In addition to these common properties, each field also has its own range of settings. For example, a <strong>list</strong> can have data entered manually, via a form, or from an external data source such as SharePoint or Salesforce and that list can be displayed as a dropdown, radio, multiselect or checkbox list.</p><h2 id=connecting-to-datasources>Connecting to datasources</h2><p>By connecting Kianda forms to existing external datasources such as lists in SharePoint, Google Drive or SQL tables, your processes will always stay relevant, up-to-date and perform as your data grows, creating a scalable solution.</p><p>There are currently 19 different predefined data connectors that allow you to connect external data sources to Kianda processes, as outlined in this video.</p><p><em><strong>Example connecting to a SharePoint datasource</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src=/videos/dataconnectsharepoint.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><p>The example in the video shows how a list field that is connected to SharePoint information can be used in a form, so that as the list grows on SharePoint, the information in the Kianda process will update dynamically.</p><p>The list field, in conjunction with datasources, allows you to define an unlimited level cascading dropdown hierarchy very easily.</p><h3 id=cascading-dropdown-example>Cascading dropdown example</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s say, for example, that you have SharePoint or Salesforce lists of customers in different countries and different cities. You can then use the list data source conditions options to filter content based on that parent list.</p><p>This video shows how cascading lists connected to data sources works in practice.</p><p><em><strong>How to create cascading dropdowns</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

This video goes through some of the possiblities you have when building forms with Kianda.</p><p><em><strong>Examples of possibilities with Kianda forms</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src=/videos/possibilities.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=rules>Rules</h2><p>Rules are an important component of any process as they can be used to trigger automated actions, requiring minimal user management once created. There are 60 predefined rules in Kianda, covering areas such as workflow applications, communications and file management.</p><p>This video goes through an example of a rule that sends an automated email once a Submit button is clicked on a form.</p><p><em><strong>Examples of possibilities with Kianda forms</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src=/videos/rules.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=anonymous-forms>Anonymous Forms</h2><p>Anonymous forms are a great way of allowing people outside of your organisation to interact with your processes - for example, simple feedback forms to GDPR data requests that hop between multi divisions before sending back a response to the requester with the level of information held by the organisation.</p><p>Even with a simple contact form or feedback form, the process rarely ends when the form is submitted.

It is particularly useful in situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.</p><p>Custom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. If you need to build &ldquo;an action&rdquo;, then you should use a custom rule widget.</p><p>Custom fields allow developers to build a reusable component that can then be used by process designers in real processes.</p><p>Check-out the <a href=/docs/getting-started/welcome/low-code/>development</a> section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To start your no-code development journey, follow these simple steps:</p><p><img src=/images/one.png alt=1> <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/><strong>Plan your process</strong></a></p><p><img src=/images/two.png alt=2> <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/><strong>Design and build your process</strong></a></p><p><img src=/images/three.png alt=3> <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/publish-your-process/><strong>Publish your process</strong></a></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-f7594d67f49229ab5e8428b59b548249>1.1.3 - What is Low-Code Development?</h1><p>Low-code development offers <strong>software developers</strong> a shortcut to create something new and beneficial for their organisation. Rather than having to think about every single line of code, as a developer you can take advantage of Kianda&rsquo;s <strong>Developer</strong> section to create your own custom widgets from predefined field, rule and dashboard code.</p><p>You can also quickly use Kianda <strong>Developer</strong> to add <a href=#webhooks>webhooks</a>, providing an efficient way to push GET requests to other applications in real-time as the Kianda process runs and avoiding the need to poll for data.</p><p>Kianda uses EmberJS to build widgets, and in particular the Handlebars templating library, to power the application&rsquo;s user interface. See <a href=#emberjs-templating-basics>templating basics</a> to get started.</p><h2 id=emberjs-templating-basics>EmberJS templating basics</h2><p>With Handlebars you can quickly build web applications that are made up of different components. Handlebar templates contain static HTML and dynamic content inside Handlebars expressions, which are summoned with double curly braces: {{ }}</p><p>Dynamic content inside a Handlebars expression is rendered with data-binding. This means if you update a property, your usage of that property in a template will be automatically updated to the latest value.</p><h3 id=helpers>Helpers</h3><p>Ember gives the ability to write your helpers, to bring a minimum of logic into Ember templating. For example, let&rsquo;s say you would like the ability to add a few numbers together, without needing to define a computed property everywhere you would like to do so.</p><p><em><strong>Helper example</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/write-our-own-helpers.png alt=Helpers></p><h4 id=conditionals>Conditionals</h4><p>Statements like <strong>if</strong> and <strong>unless</strong> are implemented as built-in helpers.

For example, SharePoint Online Environment and Active Directory, SAP, SQL Server, O365 and Oracle.</p><h2 id=quality-assurance>Quality Assurance</h2><p>To ensure Kianda meets the highest quality assurance levels, we employ a number of methodologies, including:</p><ul><li>Kianda is <strong>ISO 27001 ISMS certified</strong> and audited by an external party every 6 months. Details can be accessed here: <a href=https://www.kianda.com/information-security>https://www.kianda.com/information-security</a>.</li><li>Kianda follows agile methodologies for managing product development and project deliveries. Team members are certified in Agile Project Management and Scrum Framework, ensuring we deliver best practice project documentation and product development cycles.</li><li>Kianda’s Information Security Management System (ISMS) policy is designed to protect Kianda’s information assets as well our clients’ information from all threats (whether internal or external, deliberate or accidental), to provide a security approach that satisfies our clients, and to ensure a solid understanding of security requirements and risk management practices and effective communication of security to all Kianda employees, contractors, partners, clients and third parties.</li><li>Kianda’s Information Security Policy ‘Security in Development and Support Processes&rsquo; covers Patch Management Processes, Technical Review of Operating System Changes Restrictions on Changes to Software Packages and Product Development stages.</li><li>Kianda regularly backs-up adequate copies and generations of all software, documentation and business information. Regular testing is carried out to ensure the quality and usability of backed-up resources.</li></ul><p>The Kianda Platform <strong>fully complies with General Data Protection Requirements</strong> (GDPR) and is being continually improved, with an enhancement roadmap in place.</p><h3 id=security-and-authentication>Security and Authentication</h3><p>The Kianda platform <strong>provides Single Sign On (SSO)</strong> capability with SharePoint or OneLogin. This allows users to create, view and approve forms by first logging in with their Active Directory (AD) account.</p><p>Security is provided by integration with the Clients Active Directory / O365 or other Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requirements. It can synchronise users and their groups from SharePoint, O365 or AD. The platform provides the ability for external users to integrate with SSO and MFA authentication via guest users in O365.</p><p>Kianda can be linked with active directory groups set up by the client to control permissions. The system can synchronize with the existing permissions from AD.</p><h3 id=user-management>User Management</h3><p>The Kianda platform allows for <strong>different users to have different security privileges</strong>, providing for easy administrative management of users and their access rights. Our platform allows the following user levels by default:</p><ul><li>User - can only access what is assigned to them. For example, forms and dashboards</li><li>Administrator - can access (view and edit) all</li><li>Manage partners/customers - can only access what is required to manage customer portals</li><li>Design business process - can only design business forms and workflows</li><li>Manage data sources - can only manage data sources and connections</li><li>Developer - can design new widgets within the platform</li></ul><p>The platform allows for the creation of user groups and the ability to assign these user groups to processes or dashboards as needed. Dashboard levels or particular widgets can be configured to only be visible to certain users or groups of users and data source connections can be configured in the same way to ensure the highest access control levels.</p><p>Our data classification system has been designed to support access to information based on the need to know, so that information will be protected from unauthorised disclosure, use, modification and deletion.</p><p>The Kianda platform ensures that data is never transmitted in clear text or stored in a database or file solution. The platform is hosted in MS Azure with enterprise-grade security. All data generated is encrypted at rest and in transit. Data records are also masked from a GDPR point of view. We employ Microsoft security products to automatically mask and classify personal data - which is scheduled weekly.</p><p>Overall, Kianda Technologies follows ISO ISMS policies, GDPR best practices and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) guidelines for product development. Kianda Technologies will also adhere to Client security standards.</p><h3 id=ease-of-use>Ease of use</h3><p>The Kianda Platform offers administrative interfaces that are private and segregated from user interfaces.</p><p>Kianda forms, by default, provide edit and reassign functions that are only available to admin users or configurable roles within the system. These quick actions allow admin users to make changes to an existing form record when needed. Any <strong>changes made</strong> <strong>by</strong> <strong>any user are logged</strong> in the Audit History.</p><p>In terms of designing new forms or making changes to existing designs, admin users have the ability to preview their changes before publishing within the design interface. Changes only become visible to end-users after the process or form has been published. In addition, <strong>live and test environments are provided</strong> to enterprise clients, providing the ability to test in the test environment before publishing to live.</p><p>For further ease of use, error messages are configurable within the Kianda platform. They can be created freely when forms are being designed to ensure scenarios such as data validation or indicating the next course of action. This gives flexibility to form designers to define error messages as needed.</p><p>It is easy to learn how to optimally use the Kianda platform. Kianda training is delivered by technical experts and trainers with a deep understanding of the platform, ensuring that clients&rsquo; training experience is optimised. Projects are structured so that clients’ appointed staff are involved during the whole journey of project execution. This facilitates knowledge transfer and an “on-the-job” training approach and includes specific training sessions that are run before and after solution delivery.</p><h2 id=dashboards-and-reporting>Dashboards and reporting</h2><p>The Kianda platform allows admin users to personalise dashboards based on the unique needs of users or user groups based on hierarchy - for example, only project managers see their forms status and admin users may see the full picture.</p><p>Multiple dashboards can be created and customised as required per project, per department or other configurations. <strong>Access to the dashboards can be set at a high level for the entire dashboard or certain links</strong>, lists or widgets in a dashboard and can be made accessible to certain user groups defined in the system.</p><p><em><strong>Dashboard page</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/IT_dashboard2.jpg alt="Dashboard page"></p><p>Examples of some of our dashboard features include:</p><ul><li>Number of forms awaiting approval</li><li>Number of completed forms per week/period/quarter</li><li>Split dashboards by type or department</li><li>Columns to cater for “requested by”, “date of request”, “pending approval from”, “approved by”, “rejected by”</li><li>An alerts section to highlight approvals that have been pending past X number of days</li><li>Designing layouts to group certain fields</li><li>Charts, Lists, Links, Tiles and Rich Text are available dashboard widgets</li></ul><p>The Kianda platform allows users to report on different forms within a SharePoint site (or other relevant data source), as well as for a particular form library. In addition, the platform allows reporting across multiple form libraries, SharePoint Sites, and SharePoint Site Collections. Our reporting capability goes way beyond reporting from SharePoint data, and allows <strong>combining</strong> of data from multiple data sources for reporting purposes.</p><h3 id=audit-history>Audit history</h3><p>Kianda logs and makes available all security-related events within the Audit History of each record to administrative users. Also, system logs can be made available when required.</p><p>By default, all the forms and processes created in our platform come with <strong>detailed read-only Audit History</strong>. Audit logs are created for any modifications made to records automatically and are only available to configured roles to view. Our platform allows for the set-up of an “auditor role”, with read-only access, to allow an auditor to run reports and check audit logs.</p><p>Admin users can configure optional record level viewing logs. The recording of audit logs is automatic for any changes in the forms which gives detailed field-level auditing information.</p><p>The Kianda Platform integrates with SharePoint which provides IRM (Information Rights Management) features that enable the tagging of certain data or documents not to be printed or emailed and so on.</p><h2 id=support-and-security-updates>Support and security updates</h2><p>Within the Kianda platform, administrative users and general users can report any queries or issues using the <strong>support ticket</strong> menu option available. Our platform is updated with one major release per year and patch/security releases multiple times during the year (which includes security updates). These are communicated with clients in advance.</p><p>We provide multi-levels of data recovery. This includes data version history of records, recycle bin feature and ability to recover from a point in time, backups with a time window of every 10 minutes.</p><p>Our platform supports <strong>99% uptime</strong>. We provide 99% availability; availability is calculated with the exception of scheduled maintenance.</p><p>Our services are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, excluding planned downtime. We expect planned downtime to be infrequent but will endeavour to provide customers with advance notice. If our systems fail, we treat this as a critical high priority event with an impact on our business continuity. We will do everything possible to solve the issue as soon as possible. Our web services use highly available services with <strong>geo-redundancy</strong> enabling a failover to another European region in the event of emergency.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>If you want to use Kianda for no-code development, follow these simple steps:</p><p><img src=/images/one.png alt=1> <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/><strong>Plan your process</strong></a></p><p><img src=/images/two.png alt=2> <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/><strong>Design and build your process</strong></a></p><p><img src=/images/three.png alt=3> <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/publish-your-process/><strong>Publish your process</strong></a></p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-e2fd0561e91df0dad0c1df898f3a81bc>1.2 - Logging in to Kianda</h1><p>If your organisation already has a login, go to your given Kianda login page.

The current process may require an employee to email their line manager to request to attend training. The line manager either approves or disapproves the request by returning an email or calling the employee. If the training request is approved, then the line manager emails the training manager stating that the employee will attend training and to schedule this.</p><p><img src=/images/emails.png alt="Email trail"></p><p>Rather than continuing with email trails, with no easy way to see the status of each step and process overall, creating a solution in Kianda will save time, increase efficiencies and therefore reduce costs. In this way, you can become a <strong>citizen developer</strong>, a business professional who uses low-code/no-code tools to solve business needs.</p><h2 id=planning-in-an-agile-way>Planning in an agile way</h2><p>Planning involves 3 considerations: <a href=#planning-your-design><strong>Design</strong></a> , <a href=#planning-interaction><strong>Interaction</strong></a> and <a href=#planning-management><strong>Management</strong></a>. We will now look at each of these areas in turn.</p><p><em><strong>Planning process</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/highlightplan.png alt=Planning></p><p>To plan a solution, you could use Microsoft Office Tools or another preferred program or method to chart out what you need. Each heading will guide through what you need to consider.</p><p>If you already have a process workflow mapped out, you can go straight to <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/>designing and building</a> in Kianda.</p><h2 id=planning-your-design>Planning your design</h2><p>Design considers what a process needs to do and how it might look. Information can be gathered through various methods like Really Round Robin, hackathons and surveys, and captured in product vision boards. Using the 5W&rsquo;s of who, what, when, where and why, along with how, can help map out the necessary information during the project initiation phase.</p><p>In particular, consider what <strong>forms</strong> you need in your process. What kinds of <strong>fields</strong> do you need in order to get the data you seek? What about information you need to provide to form users? Connecting to <strong>datasources</strong> like information in SharePoint, Salesforce or SAP will make your processes dynamic and always up to date.</p><p>In the example of the Training Request process we already discussed, we will need two forms: 1) Training Request form and 2) Training Approval form. The information that we need to capture in each form is listed here, with potential field types in brackets. The information that will be provided to users in each form, for example a SharePoint list for users to scroll through, is also listed.</p><table><thead><tr><th>1) Training Request Form</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Information provided:</strong></td><td>Type of Training (a SharePoint list)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Information needed</strong>:</td><td>Employee Name (textbox)</td><td>Reason for the Request (textbox)</td><td>Line Manager (user picker)</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>2) Training Approval Form</th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Information provided</strong>:</td><td>Name, Reason, Type (group from Request form)</td><td>Line Manager (signature)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Information needed</strong>:</td><td>Decision (a Yes/No radio list)</td><td>Feedback (text box)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you begin to capture the requirements for the process you want to create, it may be useful to refer to the different types of fields available in Kianda - see <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/controls/>Controls</a> for more information on field types.</p><h2 id=planning-interaction>Planning interaction</h2><p>Interaction considers how users will use the process and what series of events might happen to create different desired outputs. Decide on the sequence of events and what <strong>rules</strong> can or need to be applied to create a trigger for the next event in the process.</p><p>In the Training Request process, we&rsquo;ll introduce <strong>Submit</strong> buttons to trigger actions, and a <strong>Rule</strong> so that the form will appear differently based on different user inputs.</p><table><thead><tr><th>1) Training Request Form</th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Actions</strong>:</td><td>Submit (button) allows Employees to submit a form.</td><td>Save (button) to save a draft form.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rule</strong>:</td><td>Send email to a Line Manager when form is submitted.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>2) Training Approval Form</th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Actions</strong>:</td><td>Submit (button) allows Line Managers to submit an approval.</td><td>Save (button) to save a draft.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>The approval appears in a dashboard for the Training Manager.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rule</strong>:</td><td>If Yes is chosen from a radio list, then input signature.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>If No is chosen, then hide the signature and show a Reason text box.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you start to think about what rules you may need to trigger the sequence of events in your process, it may be useful to refer to the different types of rules available in Kianda - see <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/rules/>Rules</a> for more information.</p><h2 id=planning-management>Planning management</h2><p>Next, you need to consider <strong>who will have access</strong> to the information. When designing forms, you can enable elements within a form so that they appear as visible-only or editable.</p><p>You also need to consider who the <strong>form owners</strong> will be, that is, who will have editing access to the forms themselves. This information is needed when you create a process and add forms to it. At this point, you will need to decide what users, or groups will act as form and process administrators. Here, we have outlined the form owners and users for the two forms in our Training Request process example:</p><table><thead><tr><th>1) Training Request Form</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Access</strong>:</td><td>All Employees can access the form.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Owner</strong>:</td><td>Only the Training Manager can edit the form template.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>2) Training Approval Form</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Access</strong>:</td><td>Only Line Managers can access the form.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Owner</strong>:</td><td>Only the Training Manager can edit the form template.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=summary-of-requirements>Summary of requirements</h2><p>Finally, we can summarise all the information we need in a spreadsheet. Field types or controls and rules will become more familiar as you work with Kianda.

Kianda can be used in two ways:</p><ul><li>As a <strong>Designer or Administrator</strong> you can use the platform to <strong>design digital applications</strong> to drive your business. Prototypes can be built quickly and easily without the need for coding experience using Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> to create processes and forms to look and work the way you want. Choose from 16 predefined field types and 60 rules to create your forms within your processes. And if you don&rsquo;t like those and have some coding experience, use the no-code part of the platform Kianda <strong>Developer</strong> to create customised field, rule and dashboard widgets.</li><li>As a <strong>platform user</strong>, use the platform to <strong>input data</strong>, or gather and <strong>use data from external datasources</strong> like Salesforce or SAP, and then <strong>monitor process execution in a dashboard</strong> using seven widget types, from lists to chart, to get an at-a-glance overview of efficiencies or bottlenecks in your organisation. Forms and processes can also be shared with partner organisations or sent as anonymous links for third parties to complete.</li></ul><h2 id=how-does-kianda-work>How does Kianda work?</h2><p>The Kianda platform no-code / low-code (NCLC) platform is created with the ultimate flexibility and agility in mind, allowing simple user interactions to build complex processes.</p><p>Kianda has been constructed using an <strong>Model, View, Controller (MVC) approach</strong> (Model, View, Controller). This approach allows designers to build mobile-responsive applications via <strong>rapid User Interface (UI) prototyping</strong>. The UI provides an easy way to build an application by clicking, scrolling, and drag and drop of fields. The layout both provides a way to both build the application or process schema, and to capture and monitor data at run-time.</p><h3 id=whats-under-the-hood>What&rsquo;s under the &lsquo;hood&rsquo;?</h3><p><img src=/images/carhood.png alt="Man peering under the hood or bonnet of a car"></p><p>The MVC approach enables user or system-supplied data captured through fields within forms, to react or trigger defined rules associated with fields, forms or processes, via the <strong>rules engine</strong>.</p><h3 id=the-kianda-rules-engine>The Kianda <strong>rules-engine</strong></h3><p>The Kianda rules engine consists of:</p><ol><li>Rule blocks - these are blocks that unlock specific functionality using a toolkit approach</li><li>Flexible and declarative conditional logic</li></ol><p>These two components (rule blocks and conditional logic) are used extensively and recursively by designers to build the required orchestration of actions or rules that interact with data to provide the required functionality for your apps or processes.</p><p>The rules engine, combined with conditional logic enables designers to build ambitious, progressive web applications or end-to-end digital business processes that offer both a great UI and high performance.</p><p>In addition to the rules engine, CSS3, HTML5, EmberJS, WebApi and NodeJS are some of the underlying technologies used within the platform.</p><div class="alert alert-primary" role=alert><blockquote><h4 id=what-makes-kianda-great-is-the-simplicity-and-unbounded-flexibility-it-gives-citizen-developers-and-low-code-developers-alike-when-building-enterprise-digital-solutions>What makes Kianda great is the simplicity and unbounded flexibility it gives citizen developers and low-code developers alike when building enterprise digital solutions.</h4></blockquote></div><p><img src=/images/chartgraphic.png alt="Chart of Kianda benefits"></p><p>In summary the Kianda platform provides an ideal interface for rapid prototyping and delivering outcomes quickly.</p><h2 id=what-does-kianda-look-like>What does Kianda look like?</h2><p>The Kianda user interface or <strong>workspace</strong> is designed to be responsive and intuitive, allowing you to easily create and control your business processes.

Users with the role <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong> can create <strong>forms</strong> that can connect to any number of <strong>data sources</strong> at the same time. The form might be a simple contact form or something else more complex, and you can add more forms like &ldquo;Follow-up form&rdquo; or even a &ldquo;Closure form&rdquo;. To the form you can add predefined <strong>controls</strong> or fields, and <strong>business rules</strong> to define how the processes can behave.</p><img src=/images/process-elements.jpg alt=process-forms-controls-rules style=zoom:70%><p>These process elements, <strong>processes</strong>, <strong>forms</strong>, <strong>controls</strong> and <strong>rules</strong> are explained in the sections below:</p><ul><li><a href=#creating-your-first-process>Creating your first process</a></li><li><a href=forms>Forms</a></li><li><a href=#form-fields>Controls or form fields</a></li><li><a href=#rules>Rules</a></li></ul><p>Forms, fields and rules are created and edited using Kianda <a href=#kianda-designer-introduction>Designer</a> explained in further on this page.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>Although Kianda aims to be intuitive and easy to get started, it is never difficult to over-engineer. So at Kianda we always recommend doing some simple planning before you design your first form. It could be something as simple as a quick flow chart or a spreadsheet where you can quickly log the key components, fields or rules that are needed in the process.</p><p>In general there are three key steps to build a process in an agile manner:</p><ol><li><strong>Plan</strong> process design, forms, fields, rules, log into design spreadsheet.</li><li><strong>Build</strong> forms and fields connecting to data where applicable.</li><li><strong>Publish</strong> to dashboards, launch anonymous forms or publish to data sources for end-user distribution.</li></ol><p><em><strong>Platform getting started video</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

They might be used as stages of a process and could be made active individually or at the same time known as <strong>parallel</strong> forms.</p><p>The key rules related to designing forms for user interaction are:</p><ol><li>Forms are <strong>assignable</strong>, this means that <strong>only a form assignee can edit</strong> a particular form in a process instance. The form assignee can be a combination of users and groups.</li><li>When a form is created, as a designer you can configure form owners. <strong>Only form owners can edit</strong> a given form in a process instance by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</li><li>Processes that have several steps use the concept of <strong>current form</strong>, where only the current form is <strong>editable</strong> in a process instance. Forms become the current form as the process executes sequentially. Rules like <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/go-to-form/>Go to form</a> can be used to make forms the current form. Other forms can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form. This means it is also possible to edit these forms at the same point in process execution and togther the forms form a form group.</li></ol><p>The rules above work together to determine if the form is in edit mode or display mode. Form designers have at their disposal <a href=/docs/platform/rules/>business rules</a> such as <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a>, <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/go-to-form/>Go to form</a> and <a href=/docs/platform/rules/form-actions/submit-form/>Submit form</a> to dynamically control the ability for end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.</p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

Fields include textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table, to name a few. Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be adjusted to work with a myriad of scenarios.</p><p><em><strong>Example of a form in a process with a text box field</strong></em>
<img src=/images/textbox-example.jpg alt="Textbox example"></p><p>Each field comes with its own set of:</p><p>a) <strong>settings</strong> like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input</p><p>b) <strong>properties</strong> that determine how the field will display.</p><p>The following are some of the common <strong>properties</strong> of input fields. Field properties <strong>appear when the field is selected</strong> within a form, as shown in the image above for the text box field. The properties appear on the right:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Title</strong> - every field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user</p></li><li><p><strong>Show title</strong> - check this property to show the title of a field in a form</p></li><li><p><strong>Required</strong> - this Boolean property allows a form designer to make a field mandatory or not</p></li><li><p><strong>Enabled</strong> - check this property to make the field appear in a form for a user to use</p></li><li><p><strong>Visible</strong> - displays the field in the form or not depending on checking the checkbox</p></li><li><p><strong>Layout</strong> - defines both desktop or mobile layout by selecting a size from the blue bar presented, see <a href=#responsive-form-layout>Responsive form layout</a> for more details.</p></li></ul><p>In addition to the field properties, each field has it&rsquo;s own settings that you can change simply by selecting the field and clicking on the <strong>Edit/Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit/pen button">. This will open an <strong>Edit field</strong> dialog box where you can change settings.</p><p>In total there are 16 predefined field widgets, see <a href=#categories-of-fields>Categories of fields</a> below. In case none of these satisfies your specific needs and if you have some level of <a href=/docs/platform/administration/developer/>development</a> skills you can always create your custom field widget.</p><h2 id=categories-of-fields>Categories of fields</h2><p>Currently the default fields fall into four main categories of fields:</p><ol><li><strong>Input</strong> - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields.</li><li><strong>Layout</strong> - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields.</li><li><strong>Action</strong> - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components.</li><li><strong>Custom</strong> - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields available under your developer section.</li></ol><p>The following headings showcase examples of fields and how they can be used to play an important role when building a modern user interface while allowing you to achieve the pixel perfect layout you want.

Examples of ways to customise forms are shown in the following sections, <a href=#responsive-form-layout>Responsive form layout</a> and <a href=#input-validation>Input validation</a>.</p><h3 id=responsive-form-layout>Responsive form layout</h3><p>When designing forms, its easy to change the layout of fields to make the field display the way you want. Form fields are made with a mobile-first approach giving you a &lsquo;design once and deploy everywhere&rsquo; opportunity.</p><p>When you select a field, you can go to <strong>Field properties</strong> in the right-hand pane of Kianda Designer and click on the <strong>Layout</strong> option.</p><p>Clicking on <strong>Collapse or expand responsive layout</strong> button <img src=/images/collapse-responsive-button.jpg alt="Collapse responsive layout button"> uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.</p><p><img src=/images/layout-mode.png alt="Layout mode"></p><p>Click on the blue bar for both <strong>Layout</strong> and <strong>Mobile Layout</strong> to adjust the size of the field. This allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows designing web interfaces with a mobile-first approach.</p><h3 id=input-validation>Input validation</h3><p>As with editing the layout of fields, it is easy to validate input, making fields mandatory for users to fill in or not. Go to <strong>Field properties</strong> in the right-hand pane of Kianda Designer and click on the <strong>Required</strong> option. If already ticked, uncheck this to make the field not required.</p><p><img src=/images/field-properties-example.jpg alt="Field properties for the field &amp;lsquo;City&amp;rsquo;"></p><p>Simply enable the checking the <strong>Required</strong> property in this way will automatically prevent users from submitting forms with an empty field. The required flag will conveniently be ignored in case the field is not visible, this will allow you to configure conditionally mandatory fields.</p><p>Another way of validating input is to use the <strong>validate input rule</strong> which allows for greater flexibility in terms of when or what to validate. <a href=#rules>Rules</a> are explained below, but click on <a href=/docs/platform/rules/form-actions/validate-input/>Validate input</a> for more information specifically on this rule.</p><p>In addition to changing field properties, you can configure <a href=#settings>settings</a> to make processes perform the way you want.</p><h2 id=settings>Settings</h2><p>In addition to <strong>changing field properties</strong> like <a href=#input-validation>Input validation</a>, you can <strong>edit process, form and field</strong> <strong>settings</strong>. Having settings at each level will allow you to tweak your process design in minutes.</p><p>At the highest level, <strong>process settings</strong> are found in the right-hand side pane of Kianda <strong>Designer</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/process-settings.jpg alt="Process settings"></p><p>There are many options within <strong>Settings</strong> to manage for example process security and set process instance settings. One setting example is <strong>Enabling anonymous sharing of forms</strong> explained in more detail below.</p><p><img src=/images/process-settings-anonymous.jpg alt="Process settings"></p><h3 id=anonymous-forms>Anonymous forms</h3><p><strong>Anonymous forms</strong> are a great way of <strong>allowing people outside of your organisation</strong> to interact with your processes. It could be something as simple as a feedback form or a GDPR data request but as we all know a contact form never ends with the contact submission. There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result back to the person that started the submission, or person assigned to manage the form.</p><p>Anonymous forms can be embedded using iframes or inline frames. Inline frames are HTML elements that allow another HTML page(s) to be loaded within the document, basically allowing one webpage within another. In Kianda there are effectively two types of anonymous forms:</p><ul><li><a href=#new-process-instance-anonymous-form-url>New process instance anonymous form URL</a></li><li><a href=#existing-instance-anonymous-form-url>Existing process anonymous form URL</a></li></ul><h4 id=new-process-instance-anonymous-form-url>New process instance anonymous form URL</h4><p>To set up a <strong>globally available link</strong> to allow external users to create a new process instance, perform the following steps within Kianda designer:</p><ol><li>Within a chosen process, in the top right click on <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Then beside <strong>Enable anonymous sharing of forms</strong> select <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>Click the button <strong>New Link</strong> to generate a new anonymous link.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/enable-anonymous-sharing.jpg alt="Anonymous Form Settings"></p><p>The generated link can be shared to allow sharing of the form to users without the need for a Kianda account.</p><h4 id=existing-instance-anonymous-form-url>Existing instance anonymous form URL</h4><p>To setup an <strong>existing instance</strong> <strong>anonymous form</strong> you need to use the <strong>Anonymous form link rule</strong> to generate a new anonymous link at runtime that will point to an existing process record that can then be shared with external users.</p><p>Note that for this to work steps 1 and 2 of <a href=#new-process-instance-anonymous-form-url>New Instance Anonymous form</a> are still required.</p><p>The following are some of the key options of the anonymous link rule:</p><ul><li>Choose a Form to share (any form within an existing process).</li><li>Link expires settings: choose from an expiry parameter like number of uses, time-based or never expire.</li><li>Select a Message to display on submission.</li></ul><p><strong>Important</strong>: There can be only one active link of each type for a given process. Once a new anonymous link is created for a process it will automatically cause an expiry of a previous link of the same type.</p><h2 id=rules>Rules</h2><p>Kianda <strong>rules</strong> allow for dynamic actions within processes that can be used to change the workflow, send automated emails or notifications, as well as manipulate data in data sources.</p><p>There are 60 predefined rules, across 10 categories that allow you to drive your business processes in a myriad of ways. Go to the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/>Rules</a> section to navigate to each of the different field categories.</p><p>Rules can be driven by <a href=/docs/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>conditions</a> for example based on user input, form fields will dynamically appear or hide according to how the user navigates a form, and all rules are <strong>actions</strong> which can involve for example retrieving values from a datasource, storing data in a field or automating user addition to Salesforce.</p><p>One example of rules already mentioned is the <strong>Anonymous form link</strong> rule which will dynamically generate and send a link from a form in a process to an external user, without the need for a Kianda account.</p><p>If the current suite of predefined rules do not meet your needs, you can use Kianda <strong>Developer</strong> to create your own rule widget. In a similar fashion you can use this function to create <a href=#custom-fields>custom controls or fields</a>, see more below.</p><h2 id=custom-fields>Custom fields</h2><p>In case any of the previously mentioned control types don&rsquo;t suit, you can use Kianda to build your own customised control widgets. The Custom fields section provides access to fields that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. It is particularly useful in those situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.</p><p>Custom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. These <strong>custom fields can be built by developers</strong>. It allows a developer to build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes. Check-out the <a href=/docs/getting-started/welcome/low-code/>development</a> section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.</p><h3 id=advanced-techniques>Advanced techniques</h3><p>Like the <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/#cascading-dropdown-lists>cascading drop-down list</a> discussed above, several other advanced scenarios can be easily configured in Kianda. Here is a short-list to give you an idea what is possible:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Repeating section</strong> - A repeating section can be created by adding a <strong>panel</strong> to a table field. This table can be configured to include a single column made of the panel that itself will include the repeating fields of your repeating section.</p></li><li><p><strong>The capture of media</strong> - Kianda enables mobile users to directly capture pictures, video or audio just like a native application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Background save</strong> - By making use of PWA principles (Progressive Web Application), Kianda allows the ability to perform background operations. This is useful when, for example, a mobile user picks-up their phone to perform a quick action and places it back in his pocket. Operations will continue in the background allowing all data to be captured.</p></li><li><p><strong>Image annotation</strong> - Kianda allows for image annotation online or offline.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multi-column / row layout</strong> - Making multi-column responsive interfaces is quite easy. Simply add two panels into a form that only use half of the screen (6 columns) then add fields inside panels and you have multiple column layouts. Adding a panel using 12 columns gives you a row.</p></li><li><p><strong>Form tab colour and icon</strong> - Form tabs can be quickly customised to display their icons or tab colours, it is also possible to define custom colours for selected and completed form tabs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hide form tab and left nav</strong> - This is self-explanatory, yes you can hide the default navigation elements.</p></li></ul><p>Once you have started creating elements in Kianda forms it is easy to replicate elements and make process design happen even faster, see <a href=#cloning>Cloning</a> below.</p><h2 id=cloning>Cloning</h2><p>In Kianda <strong>Designer</strong>, almost any of the components can be cloned. This will increase your productivity considerably and will make creating multi-step processes a breeze.</p><p>To clone either a field, a panel or even a form, simply select the component then click the clone button in the properties panel in the right-hand side of the panel.</p><p>If cloning a field, the cloning dialog box will prompt for the destination of the new cloned field, once your choice is made, simply click ok.</p><p><em><strong>Cloning a form</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

Forms are an important component of any process. They might be used as a stage of a process and can be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).</p><h2 id=how-designer-works>How Designer works</h2><p>This video introduces Kianda Designer and demonstrates how to start creating a form and add fields.</p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src=/videos/designerintro.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><p>There are 3 key principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ol><li>Form <strong>design</strong> - what a form looks like, what elements it contains, for example controls and rules</li><li>Form <strong>interaction</strong> - how users can use forms depending on certain sequences happening</li><li>Form <strong>management</strong> - who can edit and access forms</li></ol><p>This page presents the information you need related to <strong>form design</strong>, that is what a form looks like, and what it contains. By default, <strong>Administrators</strong> and those with the <strong>Design business process</strong> role can edit forms, but they can also set how other people interact with forms, for example to make forms viewable as <strong>read-only</strong>. Go to <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-owners/>Form owners</a> to find out more about how form ownership works, and <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-display-modes/>Form display modes</a> to find out out more about how forms display.</p><h2 id=designer-layout>Designer layout</h2><p>To access processes, go to the left-hand pane and <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process that you have created or imported, see <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/#creating-your-first-process>Create your first process</a>.</p><p>From the main process view, click on any process to add forms.

Forms contain all the buttons, fields, and rule triggers needed to execute your process.</p><p>Using your <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong> role, you will use Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> to design <strong>forms</strong> for <strong>end users</strong> who will use the platform to submit, save and review information, either as named users in the platform, users who receive a link to an anonymous form, or partners who can access shared processes. These end users will create new <strong>process instances</strong> or records in the system, or access <strong>existing process instances</strong> which shows information that has either been <strong>saved or submitted</strong> in a form.</p><p>When discussing forms we&rsquo;ll talk about <strong>form design</strong> that is creating and updating forms within a process using Kianda Designer as well <strong>form use</strong> which refers to editing or reading forms in a process instance/record in the system built using the form design.</p><h2 id=form-principles>Form principles</h2><p>There are three principles to consider when working with form design:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Reading modes</strong>: <strong>Form users</strong> can either use/access forms in <strong>edit</strong> mode or <strong>read</strong> mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review customer feedback in a form, but not be able to change/edit it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Current form</strong>: Typically there are several forms in a process, and by default, the <strong>first form</strong> in a process is the <strong>current form</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/3-form-example.jpg alt="Three form process example"></p><p>For example in the Training Attendance Process above, the process flow would be:</p><ul><li><p>be an employee initiates a process instance by filling out the <strong>Training Request</strong></p></li><li><p>a manager approves the request via a <strong>Training Approval</strong> form</p></li><li><p>when training approval occurs, a trainer invites the employee to training and training is complete, the trainer completes a <strong>Training Attendance</strong> evaluation of the employee.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p>​ Therefore when a process instance is initiated as a result of an employee submitting a request, then the next form in the process becomes the <strong>current form</strong>, in this case the <strong>Training Approval</strong> form.</p><p>​ Only the form that has the status ‘<strong>current form’</strong> <strong>is editable</strong>. However, in a complex multi-step process, other forms can be configured to activate with the current form, meaning they can also become editable at the same time, creating a form group, see section 2 of [New form creation](#new-f orm-creation). Rules can also be used to make forms the &lsquo;current form&rsquo;.</p><ol start=3><li><strong>Form owner</strong>: The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to, this means they can <strong>edit the current form(s) in a process instance</strong>. Default owners are typically set when a form is created, see section 1 of <a href=#new-form-creation>New form creation</a> below . By default, <strong>only this person or group can edit the <u>current</u> form</strong> in a process instance. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups. Form ownership can also be assigned dynamically using the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> rule.</li></ol><p>These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below, and these parameters can be updated at any time by editing the form design.

The image below shows a <strong>New form</strong> dialog box that is created when the <strong>Add form</strong> button is clicked in Kianda Designer. At any time if you click on a form and then the <strong>Edit/pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit/pen button"> an <strong>Edit form</strong> dialog box appears which has the same parameters as the one shown in the image below.</p><p><em><strong>New form dialog box</strong></em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/newformsegments-1.gif alt=img></p><h5 id=new-form-considerations>New form considerations</h5><ol><li>The <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field is where you can set individuals and groups as the default <strong>form owners</strong> who can edit the form.</li><li><strong>Activate with</strong> means that the form can be activated with other forms within the process, so they can be edited at the same time. This means several forms become the <strong>current form</strong> in a form group.</li><li><strong>Submit mode</strong> means that when a process instance is running you can choose <strong>only this form</strong> to be submitted, or you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong> meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved.</li><li><strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable a) reassignment, b) edit, and c) custom actions on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</li></ol><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced the principles of working with forms.

For example if an employee submits a performance review form, a line manager may wish to access that submitted process instance/record and edit the form, adding in comments and performance grades.</p><p>There are two key principles to keep in mind in terms of <strong>form access</strong>:</p><ol><li><p>Forms are <strong>assignable</strong> - this means that only a form assignee, that is, someone that is assigned to a form, can <strong>edit</strong> a particular form in a process instance. The &lsquo;assignee&rsquo; can be a combination of users and groups. There are various ways a form can be assigned to a user</p><p>​ a) Using <strong>Rules</strong>, in particular the Workflow rule Assign form, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> for details</p><p>​ b) Using <strong>Quick actions</strong>, see <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/>Form Quick action</a> for details</p><p>​ c) Creating <strong>form owners</strong> when creating or updating a process design, see <a href=#creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</a> for details</p></li><li><p><strong>Only form owners</strong> can edit a given form by <strong>default</strong>. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</p></li></ol><p>So what is <strong>form owner</strong>? A form owner is assigned when a form is created in Kianda Designer or form owners can be added to a process design at a later stage. Only the form owner will be able to edit <strong>process instances</strong> (records).</p><p>Once a process has been designed and users can initiate new process instances or records from a dashboard page, then the only people who can edit process records are the form owners or someone who has had the record assigned to them. For example, a line manager who is a form owner may need to add additional information about work goals in an appraisal form that their employee has already filled out.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-form-owners>Getting started with Form owners</h2><h3 id=creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</h3><ol><li>Click on a process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on an existing process or create a new process by clicking on <strong>Add new</strong> and complete the <strong>Add new process</strong> dialog box.</li><li>Then within Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> click on a form of interest and then click on the <strong>Edit/(Pen)</strong> <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit/Pen button"> button for that form.</li><li>In the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box you can add form owners in the <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/new-form-owners.jpg alt="Partner account details attributes"></p><p>​ Using the dropdown list choose from:</p><ul><li><strong>Users</strong> - Users must already be in the system, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/users/>Users & Groups</a></li><li><strong>Groups</strong> - Groups must be defined in advance, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/users/>Users & Groups</a></li><li><strong>Partners</strong> - Partners must be already in the system and active, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/b2b-portals/>B2B portals</a></li></ul><ol start=4><li>If you make a mistake, or form owners need to be changed in an existing process, click on the <strong>x</strong> beside the name of the <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> or <strong>Partners</strong> to remove them and choose from the dropdown list again.</li><li>Add to or edit the remaining parameters in the dialog box as desired, see <a href=#editing-forms/docs/platform/application-designer/designer/>Editing forms</a> and click on <strong>OK</strong> when complete, or <strong>Close</strong> to exit the dialog box at any time.</li></ol><h3 id=form-ownership-and-process-instances>Form ownership and process instances</h3><p>The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to <strong>when the the form is created</strong>.

The actions below refer to making forms <strong>editable</strong> so if the actions below are not used, then the forms are in <strong>read mode</strong>.</p><ol><li>Forms in process instances will be <strong>editable</strong> for <strong>Default owner(s)</strong>, that is the <strong>form owners</strong> defined when the form is created, or a form is edited. Form owners are defined in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, shown in part 1 of the image above. When a process instance runs, the form owner can then edit the form in that instance.</li><li>By default the first form in a process becomes the <strong>current form</strong>, so only this form will be <strong>editable</strong> for form owners. However if several forms are <strong>activated with</strong> the current form, defined when the form is created or edited in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, then <strong>all forms in that group</strong> will be editable by the form owner in a process instance, as shown in part 2 of the image above.</li><li>By default the <strong>Submit mode</strong> is <strong>only this form</strong> meaning that when a process instance is running you can choose only that particular form can have details submitted. Alternatively you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong> meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved. For example if several forms are activated together and all are in <strong>edit mode</strong> then the details of all these forms can be submitted together.</li><li>Forms can be statically set to allow <strong>Quick actions</strong> including allowing <strong>editing</strong>. When a form is created or edited using the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, clicking on <strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable a) <strong>reassignment</strong>, b) <strong>edit</strong>, and c) <strong>custom actions</strong> on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means the user(s) assigns the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</li></ol><h3 id=changing-form-display-with-rules>Changing form display with rules</h3><p>If you use the <strong>Form action</strong> rule called <strong>Field display mode</strong> you can change how a field or form displays dynamically.</p><p>When you add this rule, under <strong>Action</strong> you can choose a field or form and choose from <strong>Edit mode</strong> or <strong>Read mode</strong>.

To read more about process instances and settings go to the links below:</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-60eb5e695513b9a33c8bb16760f82262>2.2.3.1 - Process instance</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Kianda processes are made up of <strong>forms</strong>, which in turn contain <strong>fields</strong> or <strong>controls</strong> and <strong>rules</strong>. Fields are used to take in user input, make calculations, display values and so on, and rules are used to execute actions to drive the process.</p><p><strong>Kianda Designer</strong> is used to create these forms and form elements within a process. Each process in Kianda Designer will have it’s own unique link or URL and this can be shared with other form designers for co-creation, for example, for a process named ‘Training process’ the link is:</p><p><a href=https://green-itr.kianda.com/admin/designer/training-process>https://green-itr.kianda.com/admin/designer/training-process</a></p><h2 id=process-instances>Process instances</h2><p>When your process is created in Kianda Designer, you can save the process, and then <strong>submit data</strong> to that process. When you save or submit data, then an <strong>instance</strong> of the process is created. Another name for a process instance is a <strong>record</strong>. This instance is tied to user data or calculated values, or to whatever the process is designed to do.</p><p>The instance has a unique ID which can be seen in a list widget in a <strong>dashboard</strong>. For example, this List widget displays the individual records of various training requests submitted by employees. The unique ID for each record is shown in the first column. Form owners or those with security access can click on ID ‘training-request-and-feedback-process-26’ to view the training request form completed and submitted by employee Mark Donnelli.</p><p><em><strong>List widget in a dashboard showing process instances</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/process-instance.jpg alt="Process instance example"></p><p>This means that each new record generated by a process will have its own unique URL that can be shared with those who have the required security access and need to be involved in that <strong>particular process instance</strong>. For example, in this case, the training request submitted by Mark (an employee) may be viewed and approved by his line manager:</p><p><a href=https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/training-request-and-feedback-process-26>https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/training-request-and-feedback-process-26</a></p><p>You can create a link on your dashboard – in the example shown above, the <strong>Start new process</strong> button at the top right of the Training Requests list widget – that enables you to create a <strong>new record</strong> by bringing you into the relevant form. For information on creating list widgets go to <a href=docs/platform/pages/list/>List widget</a>.</p><p>If you commit to the process by <strong>submitting or saving information</strong>, then the result is a new process instance – that is, a new unique record – which will be seen in a list widget in the dashboard, as seen in the image above.</p><p>Keeping in mind that Designer is used to create processes, and that each ‘run’ of the process design results in a unique process instance or record, will help you later on when designing forms and dashboards. See <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/process/settings/>Process settings</a> for more details on process settings and parameters and <a href=/docs/platform/pages/>Dashboards</a> for more information on dashboards.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-30241befc918a07e3bbc2e7a304be0e5>2.2.3.2 - Process settings</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>There are a number of properties and settings that you can implement to your process and forms.</p><p><em><strong>Settings and properties</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/settingsprocess.png alt="Process and form properties"></p><p>Settings are available from the right-hand pane and give you the ability to:</p><ul><li><p><a href=#import-forms>Import processes</a></p></li><li><p>View <a href=getting-started/create_process/version_history.md>Version history</a></p></li><li><p>Change <a href=#process-settings>Process settings</a> <img src=/images/settings.png alt="Settings button"></p></li><li><p>Edit form information by selecting a form and clicking on the <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen icon">.</p></li><li><p>Change a field to another field by clicking on <strong>Change field</strong></p></li><li><p>Create a duplicate form by selecting a form, clicking on the <strong>Clone</strong> button <img src=/images/clone.png alt="Clone button"> and then click on <strong>Ok</strong>.

The fields you add in, such as a text box, list or button are called <strong>Design fields</strong>. For example as seen in <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/process/properties/#field-properties>Field properties</a> you can change properties for a textbox field, like making the field <strong>Required</strong> and <strong>Visible</strong> for form users as shown in the image below for the Training Request form field called &lsquo;Employee Name&rsquo;</p><p><img src=/images/settingsprocess.png alt=.></p><p>These design fields are also apparent when creating <strong>dashboards</strong>, for example <strong>list</strong> widgets. In the example below we can see the <strong>Design fields</strong> highlighted that are found in the Training Request form. These highlighted fields like <strong>Employee Name</strong> will appear in the list widget in the dashboard.</p><p><img src=/images/design-fields-example.jpg alt="Example of design fields in a list widget"></p><p>Clicking on <strong>List fields</strong> in list widget shown above will <strong>show all the fields</strong> that will appear in the widget.</p><p><img src=/images/list-field-defaults.jpg alt="List field example"></p><p>Note that non Design fields are also included in the fields to display, namely <strong>ID</strong>, <strong>Process Name</strong> and <strong>Modified</strong> fields. These fields are part of the set of <strong>Common fields</strong> associated with all Kianda processes.</p><h2 id=common-fields>Common fields</h2><p>The non-design fields associated with all Kianda processes are listed below. It is useful to keep these fields in mind when designing forms, as they can be used to retrieve, store or display values from <strong>process instances</strong> for example <strong>Status</strong> which is the status of a process instance. Using these &lsquo;internal values&rsquo; could be useful where the status of one process could be used as a condition to trigger the start of another process, for example using the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/start-a-process/><strong>Start a process</strong></a> rule.</p><p>The common fields associated with process instances are:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Field name</th><th>Explanation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>ID</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>process instance ID</strong>, labelled as &lsquo;process-name-number&rsquo;, for example &lsquo;safety-inspection-8&rsquo;. This ID is part of the URL that brings you to the process instance/record held on the system when information is either submitted or saved. For example clicking on the process instance ID &lsquo;safety-inspection-8&rsquo; in a dashboard brings you to the form for example &lsquo;<a href="https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/safety-inspection-8'">https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/safety-inspection-8'</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Unique ID</strong></td><td>This is a <strong>system generated ID</strong> for each process instance, a 32 letter and number generated value.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Status</strong></td><td>This is the status for the process instance, that is either a &lsquo;<strong>form name</strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<strong>Completed</strong>&rsquo;. Completed indicates that all forms in a process have been submitted, while &lsquo;form name&rsquo; indicates what the active form is in the process, that is, where the process is &lsquo;at&rsquo;. For example in a process of two forms, a Request form and an Approval form. Once the Request form has been submitted then the status for a process is &lsquo;Approval form&rsquo; indicating that this form needs to be completed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Version</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>process instance version number</strong> that starts as 1.0. If a process instance is updated, for example if a process design is updated and published and process instances are updated with the change, then the next version of the instance will be 2.0.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Process Version</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>process design version</strong>, that is the version of the process design that has been used as a template for the process instance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Process Name</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>Unique ID name</strong> that comes from the process design that is the template for the process instance. The ID is created when the process is created. The ID field autofills from the title of the process as shown in <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/#creating-your-first-process>Create your first process</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Process Title</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>Process title</strong> that comes from the process design title, created when the process is created or updated, for example see <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/#creating-your-first-process>Create your first process</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Created</strong></td><td>This is a <strong>date and time stamp</strong> when the process instance is created.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Created by</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>user name</strong> of the user who <strong>created</strong> the process instance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Modified</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>date and time stamp</strong> when the process instance is modified, for example after a process design is published and existing process instances are updated.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Modified by</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>user name</strong> of the user who <strong>modified</strong> the process instance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Assign to</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>user name</strong> of the user who a process is <strong>assigned</strong> to. Process designs may have a static option for reassignment in their design so that process instances can be reassigned using <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/#how-to-get-started>Quick actions</a>. Alternatively the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> rule can be used to dynamically assign form ownership to another user. That user is named in the <strong>Assign to</strong> field.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Security users</strong></td><td>These are the named security users, defined using <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/process/settings/#process-settings><strong>Process settings</strong></a> by selecting <strong>Enable process security</strong> and naming <strong>Process security users</strong> which can be <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> and/or <strong>Partners</strong>.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><ul><li>To learn more about design controls that can be applied to forms go to <a href=/docs/platform/controls/><strong>Controls</strong></a>.</li><li>To learn more about how common fields are displayed in dashboards in a list widget go to <a href=/docs/platform/pages/list/><strong>List widget</strong></a>.</li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-d1c93048d6cea1e969ef5152b4e0edb6>2.3 - Controls</h1><p><strong>Controls</strong> (commonly called <strong>fields</strong>) are predefined field widgets that allow you to add specific elements to your forms and processes, such as lists, text boxes, buttons and tables.

This option works in conjunction with the <strong>Allow uploading multiple files</strong> option - if you choose to allow multiple files to be uploaded, then the &lsquo;Allow file override&rsquo; option is no longer relevant (as uploading more files will not override file/files already uploaded).</p></li><li><p><strong>Allow remove file</strong>: If you select <strong>Yes</strong>, this allows the form user to come back into the form and remove the file they had previously uploaded, and another option appears - <strong>Remove and delete file</strong>: if you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, when the file is removed, it will also be deleted from the location where it was stored specified in the <strong>Save location</strong>; if you choose <strong>No</strong>, then only the reference to the file is removed from the form and the file remains in the <strong>Save location</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Allow uploading multiple files</strong>: Choose <strong>No</strong> to only allow the user to upload one file or choose <strong>Yes</strong> to allow the user to upload multiple files.</p></li><li><p><strong>File name options</strong>: Choose whether to keep the original file name, to have the file name auto generated by the system, or to be based on a form field. If you choose <strong>From form field</strong>, another option appears - <strong>File name field</strong> - allows you to select a field representing the name of the file:</p><p><img src=/images/file-name-field.jpg alt="File name field"></p></li><li><p><strong>File extension</strong>: You can set/limit the type of file(s) that can be uploaded by inserting a specific file type. For example, if you insert <strong>.pdf</strong> in the File extension box, when the user browses for the file to attach, the file type will automatically be set to .pdf. If you want to allow any type of file to be attached, leave this option blank.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enable media capture</strong>: If you choose <strong>Yes</strong>, this enables the user to capture media to upload - on a mobile device, when the user clicks on the Upload button their camera/video recorder will open (depending on whether you&rsquo;ve selected the file extension to be image or video).</p></li><li><p><strong>Button text</strong>: By default, the File upload icon has the text <strong>Browse</strong>, but you can change this here.</p></li><li><p><strong>Button icon</strong>: By default, the file upload icon is <img src=/images/file-upload-icon.jpg alt="File upload icon"> but you can change this by clicking the <strong>Button icon</strong> drop-down menu and choosing a different icon from the large range of icons available.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enable background upload</strong>: Select this checkbox to enable files to be uploaded using a background operation. This option is typically used in conjunction with the <strong>Enable chunked upload</strong> option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enable chunked upload</strong>: Select this checkbox to upload files using resumable chunks. This option can be useful if the file size is likely to be large or the network speed is likely to be slow.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you select <strong>Enable background upload</strong> and <strong>Enable chunked upload</strong> there is an additional step you need to take to ensure that these upload options work. In your form, you need to select <u>each field or button</u> that has a <strong>Save process rule</strong> applied to it, click on that rule to open the <strong>Edit rule</strong> dialog box and select the <strong>Perform background save</strong> checkbox. Then click <strong>OK</strong>. This will ensure that the upload options you&rsquo;ve chosen for your File upload field work as intended.</p><p>For example, you would need to select the &lsquo;Save process&rsquo; rule attached to the &lsquo;Save&rsquo; button in your form (by clicking on the <strong>Save</strong> button and then clicking on the <strong>Save process</strong> rule):</p><p><img src=/images/selecting-save-process-rule.jpg alt="Selecting Save Process rule"></p><p>This opens the <strong>Edit rule - Save form</strong> dialog box - check the <strong>Perform background save</strong> option and then click <strong>OK</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/save-process-rule-perform-background.jpg alt="Edit rule dialog box perform background save"></p><p>If the <strong>Enable background upload</strong> and <strong>Enable chunked upload</strong> options are chosen and a user completes a form while they are in an area with poor coverage, once the user re-establishes internet connection they will need to go back into Kianda and click the <strong>Force refresh</strong> button <img src=/images/refresh.png alt="Refresh button"> at the top right of the <strong>Home</strong> page.</p></li><li><p><strong>Show uploaded files count</strong>: Select <strong>Yes</strong> to show the number of uploaded files.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Once you complete the <strong>New field - File</strong> dialog box and click <strong>OK</strong>, a new <strong>File upload field</strong> is added to your form, with the name you inserted as the <strong>Title</strong> in the dialog box (by default the title is <strong>File 1</strong> unless you change it).</p><p>In the example of our Inspection Form, the new File upload field (titled <strong>Upload photos</strong>) added to the form could look like this when a user views it on a mobile phone (to see how your form or field will look on a mobile, view it in <strong>Mobile preview</strong> by using the <strong>Preview</strong> option which can be opened by clicking the play button icon <img src=/images/preview.png alt=Preview>):</p></li></ol><p><img src=/images/file-upload-example-mobile.jpg alt="File upload example mobile phone"></p><h3 id=how-to-edit-move-and-delete-file-upload-fields>How to edit, move and delete File upload fields</h3><p>To edit a <strong>File upload field</strong>:</p><ol><li>Select the File upload field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field&rsquo;s <strong>drag handle</strong> button <img src=/images/draghandlewhite-frame.png alt="Drag handle button">)</li><li>Click on the <strong>Edit field</strong> button (Pen icon) <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit field button"></li></ol><p><img src=/images/file-upload-edit-field.jpg alt="Select file upload field to edit"></p><ol start=3><li>The <strong>Edit field - File</strong> dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the <strong>New field - File</strong> dialog box (as already discussed in <a href=/docs/platform/controls/input/file-upload#how-to-get-started>How to get started</a>).</li></ol><p><img src=/images/file-upload-edit-field-dialog.jpg alt="Edit date field dialog box"></p><p>​ You can make any changes you wish in this dialog box and then click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</p><p>To move a <strong>File upload field</strong>, simply:</p><ol><li>Select the field&rsquo;s <strong>drag handle</strong> button <img src=/images/draghandlewhite-frame.png alt="Drag handle button"></li><li>Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to within your form.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/upload-file-draghandle.jpg alt="Date field drag handle"></p><p>To delete a <strong>File upload field</strong> from your form:</p><ol><li>Select the field (by either clicking on the field&rsquo;s name or its <strong>drag handle</strong> button <img src=/images/draghandlewhite-frame.png alt="Drag handle button">)</li><li>Click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/binicon.png alt="Bin icon"></li><li>Click on <strong>OK</strong> to confirm</li></ol><h3 id=how-to-edit-file-upload-field-properties>How to edit File upload field properties</h3><p>To view or edit the field properties associated with a <strong>File upload field</strong>, select the field (by clicking on the field title or field drag handle button <img src=/images/draghandlewhite-frame.png alt="Drag handle button">) - the <strong>Field properties</strong> menu will appear in the right-hand pane.</p><p><img src=/images/file-upload-field-prop.jpg alt="Field properties"></p><p>For example, the <strong>Field Properties</strong> associated with a <strong>File upload field</strong> titled &lsquo;Upload photos&rsquo;

One such rule, the <strong>Show, hide or disable rule</strong> can be applied to a Toggle field to have the effect of showing or hiding remaining options/sections in the form dependent on whether the toggle/checkbox is selected or not.</p><p>For example, in a Training Request form, a Toggle field could be used to record a manager&rsquo;s decision to either approve or reject an employee&rsquo;s training request - by applying the <strong>Show, hide or disable</strong> rule to this field, a different last section of the form will display based on the manager&rsquo;s decision. If the manager select&rsquo;s to approve the training, a sign-off button then appears; if the manager reject&rsquo;s the request, a &lsquo;Reason&rsquo; text box appears for them to insert their feedback.

Often, rules are applied to buttons so that actions are automatically executed once the user clicks on the button. In this way, Button fields with rules can be used to trigger a sequence of events. To learn more about rules, go to <a href=/docs/platform/rules/>Rules</a>.</p><p>For example, as part of an Employee Appraisal Process, a manager may complete a Performance Plan form for each employee, setting out their Key Performance Areas and goals. It could be useful to add a button to this form - titled &lsquo;Schedule Meeting&rsquo; - that will automatically schedule a performance review meeting between the manager and the employee at a pre-determined date in the future.

By default, the text is &lsquo;Start Signing&rsquo; but you can change this to whatever you want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Re-Sign button text</strong> - You can choose the text you want to appear on the &lsquo;Re-Sign&rsquo; button. This &lsquo;Re-Sign&rsquo; button appears after the user has clicked the Start signing button and completed the dialog box and it enables the user to replace or override the original signature they input. By default, the text is &lsquo;Re-sign&rsquo; but you can change this to whatever you want.</p><p>In our example of adding a Signature field titled &lsquo;Manager Signature&rsquo;, once the manager has signed, the &lsquo;Re-sign&rsquo; button will be shown:</p><p><img src=/images/signature-resign.jpg alt="Re-sign button showing after completing Signature field"></p></li><li><p><strong>Show username and signing time</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> to show the Kianda username of the person who has electronically signed with the Signature field and the time they signed at (per the local time settings on the user&rsquo;s Kianda account).</p><p><img src=/images/signature-username-time.jpg alt="Signature showing username and signing time"></p></li><li><p><strong>Require user authentication</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> to require user authentication for the user clicking the Signature field button to sign the section/form.

For example, you could select a <a href=/docs/platform/controls/input/user-picker/>User picker field</a> within your form as the &lsquo;Default title of sign by&rsquo; - this would then mean that the user that is selected in that User picker field will be the default name shown in the Signature field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hide default signature tab</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want to hide the default signature tab (where an electronic signature is automatically generated). If you choose Yes, the next option - <strong>Auto save signature</strong> - will no longer be available to you.</p><p>In our example, if we select <strong>No</strong> to hiding the default signature tab, the user will see the electronically generated signature:</p><p><img src=/images/signature-default-signature.jpg alt="Default signature tab shown"></p></li><li><p><strong>Auto save signature</strong> - Select <strong>Yes</strong> if you want to auto save the signature.</p></li><li><p><strong>Button icon</strong> - You can choose an icon to appear on your Signature field button (or can opt not to have an icon on it).

For example
the order of rules on a <strong>Submit</strong> button could be: Set Status, Send Email, Submit, Save, Close, whereby the status of the process instance is set first, before an automated email and then the form shutdown rules of Submit, Save and Close occur.</p><p>To read more about multiple rules, go to <a href=/docs/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a>.</p></li></ol><h2 id=conditions>Conditions</h2><p>Flexible and dynamic conditions form an important component to make forms fully dynamic.

They are the <strong>triggers</strong> that result in fully dynamic forms. They enable you to enables you to create natural language conditions when rules should be triggered.</p><p>The <strong>Conditions</strong> button <img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/condition.png alt=img> is found within all <strong>rules</strong> as well as <a href=docs/platform/pages/>dashboard widgets</a>. Conditions can also be set when setting data source security levels for <a href=/docs/platform/b2b-portals/data-access/>B2B portals</a>.</p><p>Conditions add an important level of interactivity, creating dynamic pathways within a process. These pathways could result from user interaction or from other events that happen.</p><p>Conditions work on the ‘if…then’ principle: ‘if’ the condition exists ‘then’ an action happens, and where applicable, if the condition does not exist, then another action can happen. You can use these principles as steps to implementing conditions:</p><ol><li>Create the <strong>condition(s)</strong></li><li>Create the <strong>action(s)</strong> that will be applied as a result of the first condition being in place.</li><li>Where applicable, create the <strong>otherwise action(s)</strong> based on other conditions being in place.</li></ol><h2 id=create-the-condition>Create the condition</h2><ol><li><p>To create <strong>conditions</strong>, first choose the <strong>process element</strong> you want the condition to apply to – such as a form, set of forms, a field/control or set of fields. This could also be a set of common fields associated with all process instances, such as <strong>Process ID</strong>, <strong>Status</strong> or <strong>Modified by</strong>, see image below.</p><p><img src=/images/common-fields-in-condition.jpg alt="Common fields used in the process element part of a condition"></p></li><li><p>Next, depending on whether the rule is applied to a <strong>text-based field or date-based field</strong>, choose from 13 text operators or 25 date operators (see image below).</p></li><li><p>Then choose a <strong>value</strong>, this could be typed in text, number(s), date(s), form(s) or field(s).</p></li></ol><p><em><strong>Condition elements</strong></em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/conditions3-2.gif alt=img></p><p>In the case of <strong>multiple conditions</strong>, you can use <strong>And</strong> or <strong>Or</strong> to create a group of compound conditions:</p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/editconditions-1.gif alt=img></p><p>The result is a flexible process workflow that will result in desired actions based on any number of conditions.</p><h3 id=rule-actions--example-hide-or-disable-rule>Rule action(s) – example Hide or Disable rule</h3><p>To create <strong>actions</strong> and where applicable, <strong>otherwise actions</strong>, the <strong>action will depend on the rule</strong> that is chosen. All Kianda rules use a natural language structure to make it is easy to apply actions. For example, for the <strong>Workflow rule</strong>, <strong>Hide or Disable</strong>, you can choose forms and fields from your process and then apply seven possible actions (as shown below).</p><p>*<strong>Action elements for Hide or Disable*</strong></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hideoptions-1024x477.gif alt="7 actions for Hide or Disable"></p><p>The actions within <strong>Hide or disable</strong> are:</p><ul><li><strong>Hide</strong> will hide a process element (forms or fields) from view.</li><li><strong>Show</strong> will show the element.</li><li><strong>Disable</strong> blocks a user from editing an element.</li><li><strong>Enable</strong> allows a user to add a value to an element.</li><li><strong>Toggle visible</strong> will toggle between showing an element or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to.</li><li><strong>Toggle enable</strong> will toggle between allowing an element to be edited or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to.</li><li><strong>Hide and clear</strong> will allow you to hide a process element and clear the details. For example, if a toggle button has this rule applied, with an <strong>otherwise action</strong> of <strong>show</strong> on a textbox, then if one value is chosen on the toggle button, the user is allowed enter details into the textbox. The otherwise action is that the field is hidden and cleared of data, so that no data can be retrieved. This might be useful, for example, when sensitive information is used, like a social security number on a form.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can use rules to create <strong>actions</strong> <strong>without conditions</strong> too. In this case the rule will simply execute, for example when a form or field is clicked on.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>Depending on how the rule is applied, for example to a <strong>Submit</strong> button, the rule order is important to consider, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/general/mutiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a>.</p><p>To find out more about rule implementation, go to the main <a href=/docs/platform/rules/>Rules</a> page and then click on the links to the different rule categories.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-3ff330dcdeb484d3b41991547f27fafe>2.4.1.2 - Multiple rules</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>When working with rules in forms, a key principle to consider is <strong>rule order</strong>. Rule order is important if there are <strong>multiple rules</strong> attached to an item like a button or form field to determine the sequence of rule execution. As a form designer you can change the order of execution is important and modified form and process designs, including rule order to suit your needs.</p><p>Remember you can assign rules at:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Process level</strong> - onload rules that execute when a new process instance is initiated.</p><p><img src=/images/process-level-rule-example.jpg alt="Process level rule example"></p></li><li><p><strong>Form level</strong> - onload rules that execute when a form is submitted.</p><p><img src=/images/form-level-rule.jpg alt="Form level rules"></p></li><li><p><strong>Button/field level</strong> - rules attached to buttons or fields within forms, or at the end of a form, for example a Submit button. An example of rule order is given at this level in the section below <a href=#rule-order-example>Rule order example</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Rules are typically synchronously executed in Kianda, so for example when using a <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/start-a-process/>Start a process</a> rule, when the rule is executed first any mappings from a secondary/target process are mapped into a primary process, and from there if there are any rules to trigger on the secondary/target process those are executed, but a rule will only execute when the previous rule has completed. This is different to asynchronous execution where the system will execute rules without waiting for the previous rule execution to finish. Within time defined rules, like <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/start-a-process/>Start a process</a> and <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/schedule-a-rule/>Schedule a rule</a> there is an option to choose between synchronous/in-series or asynchronous/in-parallel where the latter may be useful for rules without dependency.</p><p><img src=/images/execute-in-series.jpg alt="Execute in series option on rules"></p><h2 id=rule-order-example>Rule order example</h2><p>For example, you may want a process to send automated emails to a safety manager, where the email includes submitted form data. In this case a <strong>Send email rule</strong> could be attached to a form <strong>Submit</strong> button so an email is sent once the button is clicked. This will result in an automated email to a designated person. To generate a report of the completed form you can use the <strong>Generate word</strong> <strong>document</strong> <strong>rule</strong> triggered again when the <strong>Submit</strong> button is clicked. In this example the <strong>Generate word document rule</strong> has to be executed <u>before</u> the <strong>Send email rule</strong>, so that the Word document can be generated and then attached to the email.</p><p>The rule order consideration is therefore particularly important when rules are <strong>dependent</strong> on each other - where the output of one rule is the input of another rule.</p><h2 id=changing-the-rule-order-of-multiple-rules>Changing the rule order of multiple rules</h2><p>In the example below we will look at changing the rule order of a Send email rule attached to a Submit button. The <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> buttons by default already have <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> process rules attached, in order to allow form shutdown.</p><p>To change rule order, when the rule is created:</p><ol><li>Click on the item that has multiple rules attached, for example a <strong>Submit</strong> button. Remember by default Submit buttons in forms will have &lsquo;form shutdown&rsquo; rules, namely <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, drag the <strong>Send email</strong> rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and drag it to the top of the list, before <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> rules.</li></ol><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ruleorder_frame.png alt=img></p><p>The video below shows an example of a <strong>Send email rule</strong> being created and saved. The rule is attached to the <strong>Submit</strong> button. Once the rule is created, by default the new rule goes to the bottom of the list of rules. To move the rule, simply click on it and drag it to where you wish to place it. In this example we want the email sent <u>before</u> any of the shutdown processes like Submit or Save, but after a <strong>Generate Inspection</strong> rule, so the output from that rule can be used in the Send email rule.</p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

This retrieved data from the datasource is known as a <strong>response</strong>. Using this response data, you can populate a field within your form, for example you can retrieve a file which is stored in your SharePoint or Dropbox datasource and populate the retrieved file into a <strong>File field</strong>. This will give you the ability to access the retrieved file in your process.</p><p>All data connectors within Kianda may have different response data that can be used to populate fields in a form. You can use the <strong>Success mapping</strong> in the rules mentioned in the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#when-to-use>When to use</a> section. Take one of the SharePoint rules <a href=/docs/platform/rules/sharepoint/create-a-site/><strong>Create a site</strong></a> as an example. When all information is filled out in the rule, in the <strong>On success mapping</strong> section you can assess the <strong>data object</strong> (response) called <strong>Site properties</strong>. From the <strong>Site properties</strong> data object you can access three different pieces of data; <strong>Site Name</strong>, <strong>Site Id</strong> and <strong>Site URL</strong>. You can map (populate) those piece of data into fields in your form by selecting a field in the <strong>Form field</strong> section:</p><p><img src=/images/success-mapping.jpg alt="Success mapping example"></p><ul><li><p><strong>Form field</strong> - this field allows you to select a field in your form to store the value from the datasource.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data source field or text</strong> - this field allows you to select which piece of data your want to retrieve from the datasource, and store it in a form field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add mapping</strong> - Click on the <strong>Add mapping</strong> to add more fields for mapping results from the datasource to form fields.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bin/Trash</strong> <strong><img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button"></strong> - Click on the <strong>Bin/Trash</strong> button <img src=/images/bin.png alt="Bin/Trash button"> to delete a mapping.</p></li></ul><h3 id=on-error-mapping>On Error Mapping</h3><p>Error mapping is a concept of populating a form field in your Kianda process when using the rules from the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/#when-to-use>When to use</a> section. When using those rules, you get presented with the ability to map an <strong>error</strong> when there is an <strong>issue</strong> as the rule is executing, for example incorrectly filling out a parameter. It is useful to know the details of the error message that comes from the datasource your are connecting with. To see the error message, you need to create a <strong>separate <a href=/docs/platform/controls/input/textbox/>Text box</a> field</strong> in your form and map the error to that field.

Using Workflow rules will allow you to change the flow of information within a process. For example in a simple Training Process that is made up of three forms by default, the <strong>first form</strong> in a process is the <strong>current form</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/3-form-example.jpg alt="Three form process example"></p><p>In the example above, the workflow for this process would be completion of the forms in this order: <strong>Training Request</strong> > <strong>Training Approval</strong> > <strong>Training Attendance</strong> however using Workflow rules, you could use <strong>Go to form</strong> to force the <strong>Training Attendance</strong> form to be the current form after the Training Request form has been completed.</p><p>You could also use the <strong>Assign form</strong> rule to assign editing rights to particular users so they can edit forms. See more about Go to form and Assign form below.</p><p>Using rules in this way changes the flow of the process, and additional levels of security and user interaction can be added using <strong>Process security</strong> and <strong>Hide or disable</strong> see below.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-workflow-rules>Getting started with Workflow rules</h2><p>If you have the role <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong> go to <strong>Administration</strong> in the left-hand side menu and then <strong>Designer</strong> and click on an existing process or create a new process, then decide on a form or field to add the rule to by clicking on that item and click on <strong>Add a rule</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Workflow</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>Workflow</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/workflow-rules.jpg alt="Workflow rules"></p><p>There are seven types of <strong>Workflow</strong> rules as follows:</p><ol><li><h3 id=hide-or-disable>Hide or disable</h3><p>This rule is used to hide, disable, <strong>show or enable one or more fields, one or more sections or entire forms</strong>. This rule has special meaning in terms of workflow allowing the application to direct user action and flow by hiding or showing entire sections of the application.</p></li><li><h3 id=make-required>Make required</h3><p>Use this rule to make individual <strong>fields required or entire forms</strong>. Unlike the field property &lsquo;Required&rsquo;, this rule will dynamically allocate a mandatory status on chosen forms or fields, that users must complete and submit.</p></li><li><h3 id=go-to-form>Go to form</h3><p><strong>Go to form</strong> rule <strong>navigates</strong> the user from the current form to the destination form. This rule could also set the destination form&rsquo;s display mode.</p></li><li><h3 id=assign-form>Assign form</h3><p>This rule <strong>enables dynamic form ownership</strong> and form security assignment of a form owner by assigning a user or a group to a form. You could also choose to override or append the form owner. By default only form owners can see the form in edit</p></li><li><h3 id=process-security>Process security</h3><p>This rule <strong>defines the security of the entire process instance</strong> (record). Using this rule, you could add any user or group with the right permissions to view/update any instances.</p></li><li><h3 id=start-a-sub-process>Start a (sub) process</h3><p><strong>Start a process</strong> rule helps you <strong>create a new instance of the same process or a different process</strong>.

Email templates are defined within the rule, allowing you to style emails the way you want and use <a href=/docs/platform/rules/general/expression-builder/>Expressions</a> to automate the process. You can map fields and content from within the process, for example using a userpicker field so that user input in a form determines who an email is sent to. Emails can be sent out using a predefined SMTP connector, see <a href=/docs/platform/connectors/email/#setting-up-a-global-smtp-mail-connector>Setting up a Global SMTP mail Connector</a> for more details.</p></li><li><p><strong>Meeting request</strong> - This rule is similar to the <strong>Send email</strong> rule and allows you to send automated specially formatted emails that contain a meeting request.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anonymous form link</strong> - This rule creates an anonymous link to a form which can be sent to external users who do not need Kianda login details or accounts to access the form(s), for example contractors or third party providers. The receivers of the link can then simply click on the link and submit data back to a process instance in Kianda.</p></li><li><p><strong>User alert</strong> - This rule sends an alert to a user which appears in the user notifications in the top right-hand quick actions menu bar. See <a href=/docs/platform/general/quickaction/>Quick action menu</a> for an introduction to the shortcuts available to users including notifications. You can configure the alert to appear the way you want for example to allow warning messages to appear as shown in the image in the <a href=#introduction>Introduction</a> or to link to a form for a user to complete.</p></li></ul><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To read more about each of the rule types go to the links below:</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-3a84f466dddb4ffa5cf293892ad306a1>2.4.3.1 - Send email</h1><p>This rule sends an email according to a predefined template.

This is a straightforward rule which allows you to connect to your data source and map inputs. You can also map a data source field or text back to Kianda on success or store an error message on failure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Delete item</strong> - To delete an item from your data connection, you could use a data source filter and map data source field or text from a data connection to Kianda form field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Update item</strong> - This rule works in the same way as the Delete item rule. At any point, if you would like to update any item on your data connection, use this rule. To find an item to update, you could use a data source filter and map the input fields or text.</p></li><li><p><strong>Find items</strong> - Use this rule together with a datasource to perform a query and return data for use with the form. To find an item, you could use a data source filter which acts as a conditional bridge between Kianda and data-connections. If the condition is true, you could map the data source field or text to the Kianda form field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set form field</strong> - This rule is used to update the value of fields in a form. The field value could be simple text or based on a custom expression with the ability to define JavaScript expressions.

The user rules also allow you to <strong>invite partners</strong> and <strong>share</strong> a particular process with them. These rules are very useful when you want to do any property actions on a user like find a user or update a property of a specific user.</p><p>Take an example of a <strong>Look up user by property</strong> rule. Implementing this rule will allow you to store a user in a <strong>User picker</strong> field by providing a property of a user, for example user role or email address.

These operations are useful when creating Word/Excel where the structure of those documents is the same for every instance but values are different. You can also use the <strong>File management</strong> rules for creating anonymous links which give access to files without permissions.</p><p>Take an example of a <strong>Create a file anonymous link</strong> rule. Implementing this rule will result in a <strong>randomly generated link</strong> which will lead to a file that you want to share. This link can be opened in <strong>any browser</strong> and can be <strong>accessible</strong> by anyone and there is <strong>no need for authentication</strong> when opening the link. You can also set the expiry time of the created link which will cause the link not to exist after the specified time. See images below for an example of the <strong>Create a file anonymous link</strong> rule:</p><p><img src=/images/file-managemt-rules-example.jpg alt="File management rules"></p><h2 id=getting-started-with-file-management-rules>Getting started with File management rules</h2><p>If you go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, then click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> the <strong>File management</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>File management</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/file-managemt-rules.jpg alt="File management rules"></p><p>There are seven types of <strong>File management</strong> rules as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Copy file</strong> - allows copying files between datasources. Use this file together with two file fields to move files between two different file locations. For example to copy files between an on premises folder and a SharePoint folder.</p></li><li><p><strong>Convert to PDF</strong> - this rule allows the conversation of DOCX and DOC files into PDF format.</p></li><li><p><strong>Generate word document</strong> - this rule generates a Word document from data associated with a process instance using a user-designed template.</p></li><li><p><strong>Generate excel document</strong> - this rule generates an Excel workbook from data associated with a process instance using a user-designed template.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set existing file</strong> - this rule is used to make an existing file accessible by a link, available within a configured file field. For example when you have access to a file through a link, you can use this link to store the file in a file field within your process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Merge PDF</strong> - this rule allows you to merge two or more PDF files into a single PDF file. It also allows you to merge image file such as PNG or JPG to an existing PDF file.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create a file anonymous link</strong> - this rule generates file links that can be shared anonymously with external users.

Using this rule automates and speeds up the process of populating a table when a lot of data is present. CSV files may look different depending on what program you will open it with, here is an example of a CSV file opened with <strong>Excel</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/csv-file-excel.jpg alt="CSV file - excel"></p><p>Here is the same file opened using <strong>Notepad</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/csv-file-notepad.jpg alt="CSV file - notepad"></p><p>As shown in the two images above, the format changes depending on what <strong>program</strong> you <strong>open</strong> the file with. Using the <strong>Notepad</strong>, each column is <strong>separated</strong> with a <strong>comma</strong> and <strong>each new line is a row</strong>. <strong>Excel</strong> formats commas and new lines automatically and creates <strong>numbers for rows</strong> and <strong>letters for columns</strong>. The CSV file can be separated using <strong>different separators</strong> other than comma. For example you can use <code>;</code> as a separator, keep in mind that <strong>Excel</strong> does <strong>not format non-comma separated values correctly</strong> and the file will look as follows when opened using <strong>Excel</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-semicolon.jpg alt="CSV file - excel"></p><p>Here is the same file opened using <strong>Notepad</strong>:</p><p><img src=/images/csv-file-notepad-semicolon.jpg alt="CSV file - excel"></p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can use this rule to populate a table when there is a lot of data present in a CSV file.

For more detail on how to add a file go to <a href=/docs/platform/controls/input/file-upload/>File upload control</a>.</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that in order to populate a table within your process correctly, you need to have the <strong>same amount of columns</strong> in the table as inside of the CSV file. For example a table looking as follows:</p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-table.jpg alt="Import CSV rule - Sample table"></p><p>This indicates that the CSV file that we want to import should have three columns:</p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-file.jpg alt="CSV file"></p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol><li><p>Click on an existing process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and decide which form, or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in <strong>edit mode</strong> so you can see the Edit/pen button, <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen button">.</p></li><li><p>Click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Table</strong> > <strong>Import CSV</strong>.</p></li><li><p>In the <strong>Edit rule - Import CSV</strong> dialog box, give the rule a title in the <strong>Title</strong> field.</p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-edit-rule.jpg alt="Edit rule - Import CSV"></p></li><li><p>If you want to add conditions for the rule, click on the <strong>Edit conditions</strong> button <img src=/images/editconditions.png alt="Edit conditions button"> see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>Conditions</a> for more details.</p></li><li><p>Under the <strong>Action</strong> section fill out the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Select the CSV file field</strong> - select a file field containing a csv file.

Keep in mind that the separator fields separates each column of a row. For example you can have a file that looks as follows:</p><p><em>This image represents how a table looks like applying the Import CSV rule with a sample file and when the CSV separator is set to a comma ( <strong>,</strong> ) see below:</em></p><p><img src=/images/import-csv-comma.jpg alt="Comma separated CSV file"></p></li><li><p><strong>Num cols. in CSV</strong> - this field represents the number of columns in your CSV file.

You can utilise this rule to format the entered date so that it matches various national date formatting standards. The default formatting for Kianda dates are <em>DD/MM/YYYY</em>, so in the below example an entered date of <em>23/08/2022</em> would become <em>08/23/2022</em>.</p><p><img src=/images/date-rules-format-date-screen.jpg alt="Format date screen"></p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>The format date rule should be used when you wish to amend the formatting of a date field within Kianda.

These rules are using SharePoint Application Programming Interface (<strong>API</strong>) to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (<strong>CRUD</strong>) operations within your SharePoint connector. The SharePoint rules are designed to <strong>manage</strong> your SharePoint connector instead of populating it with data. With these rules you can create a site, a list or a group on your SharePoint connector along with adding users to groups, removing them from groups or changing user or group permissions.</p><p>Take an example of a <strong>Find a user</strong> rule. Implementing this rule will result in acquiring a <strong>Username</strong> or <strong>User Id</strong> of a particular user which is part of your SharePoint users group. When using SharePoint rules that are managing users, the <strong>Find a user</strong> rule is very useful as rules such as <strong>Add user to a group</strong> or <strong>remove user from a group</strong> require a <strong>User Id</strong> that can be retrieved from the <strong>Find a user</strong> rule.</p><h2 id=before-getting-started>Before getting started</h2><p>In advance of using the SharePoint rules you must have created a SharePoint data connector and establish a connection with your SharePoint site. The data connector is used as part of the SharePoint rules to perform CRUD operations on a site you established a connection with. To learn more about the SharePoint data connector go to <a href=/docs/platform/connectors/sharepoint/>SharePoint connector</a>.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-sharepoint-rules>Getting started with SharePoint rules</h2><p>If you go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process or create a new process, then click on <strong>Add a rule</strong> the <strong>Sharepoint</strong> rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on <strong>Sharepoint</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/sharepoint-rules-all.jpg alt="Sharepoint rules"></p><p>There are 10 <strong>SharePoint</strong> rules as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Create a list</strong> - creates a new list in a SharePoint site.</li><li><strong>Create a site</strong> - creates a new site on SharePoint, enabling the use of a site template.</li><li><strong>Create a group</strong> - creates a new group on SharePoint</li><li><strong>Find a user</strong> - finds or searches for a user within SharePoint</li><li><strong>Add a user to a group</strong> - adds a SharePoint user to a SharePoint group. It is important to note the difference between SharePoint users and Kianda users. SharePoint users are users of the SharePoint system. Kianda users are users of the Kianda system.</li><li><strong>Remove a user from a group</strong> - removes a SharePoint user from a SharePoint group</li><li><strong>Reset an item permission</strong>s - changes the SharePoint permissions for a given list, document or folder.</li><li><strong>Check in / out an item</strong> - checks in or out a file in SharePoint</li><li><strong>Get attachments</strong> - reads the attachments from a SharePoint list</li><li><strong>Create anonymous link</strong> - creates anonymous links for a SharePoint held file</li></ul><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced each of the ten types of <strong>SharePoint rules</strong>.

In our example, we&rsquo;ll call it &lsquo;Filter by Employee&rsquo;.</p></li><li><p><strong>Layout columns</strong> - You can choose how wide you want your <strong>Filter widget</strong> to be. You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click to the very end of the bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.</p></li><li><p><strong>Colour scheme</strong> - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White), if you choose to display it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Show header</strong> - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your Dashboard widget to be shown.

You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click to the very end of the bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.</p></li><li><p><strong>Colour scheme</strong> - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White), if you choose to display it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Show header</strong> - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your Dashboard widget to be shown.

These functions enable you to access a number of DocuSign&rsquo;s functionalities. You can use each DocuSign function by using the <strong>Data</strong> set of rules, to learn more about Data rules go to <a href=/docs/platform/rules/data/>Data rules</a>. With each DocuSign function you use, data needs to be passed into the function know as <strong>payload</strong> and data is also returned, known as <strong>response</strong>. When using the Data rules, you are presented with <strong>Input mapping</strong> which is equivalent to the <strong>payload</strong>, this is used to pass data into the function, for example when you need a document signed, you need to pass in a document file to be signed, in other words, the document file you pass in is the <strong>payload</strong>. The <strong>Results mapping</strong> is equivalent to the <strong>response</strong>, this is used to populate your form fields when a DocuSign function returns data, for example <strong>status</strong> of an envelope.</p><p>Here is a list of all functions available when using the DocuSign data connector. To learn more about the <strong>payload</strong> and <strong>response</strong> for the available functions go to the <a href=https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/>DocuSign API Reference</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>sendDocument</strong> - allows you to send one or more documents to a recipient to get them signed.</li><li><strong>sendEnvelope</strong> - allows you to send a document to a recipient using one of your DocuSign templates.</li><li><strong>listTemplates</strong> - retrieves the <strong>templateID</strong> and <strong>templateName</strong> of all templates from your DocuSign account.</li><li><strong>getEnvelope</strong> - retrieves information from an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li><li><strong>getEnvelopeSummary</strong> - retrieves a summary of an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li><li><strong>listEnvelopeDocuments</strong> - retrieves any documents that are contained within an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li><li><strong>downloadDocument</strong> - allows you to download a specific document using a <strong>documentID</strong> from an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li><li><strong>listTemplateSigners</strong> - retrieves the name, role and <strong>recipientID</strong> of all signers from a template using a <strong>templateID</strong></li><li><strong>getSigningUrl</strong> - retrieves a URL to a signature made on an envelope using an <strong>envelopeID</strong>.</li></ul><h3 id=example-use-case-of-docusign-function>Example use case of DocuSign function</h3><p>Take the function <strong>listTemplates</strong> as an example. The <strong>listTemplates</strong> function <strong>returns (response)</strong> an <strong>ID</strong> and the <strong>Name</strong> of all templates that you have created in your DocuSign account. To use this function effectively, you can use the <strong>Find items</strong> rule with combination of the <strong>table</strong> input. The <strong>Find items</strong> rule will access all templates and map the results into the table. For each template in your DocuSign account, the <strong>Find items</strong> rule will add a table row with the appropriate <strong>Template IDs</strong> and <strong>Template Names</strong> of each template, here is the steps to achieve this:</p><p>To show case the functionality explained above, we will apply the <strong>Find items</strong> rule to a <strong>button</strong> but it can be applied to a form field, a form or a process (the rule will be executed when the process loads). Each time we press this button, a table will be populated with a list of <strong>Template IDs</strong> and <strong>Template Names</strong> from our DocuSign account.</p><ol><li><p>Create a button in your process, to learn how to create a button go to <a href=/docs/platform/controls/actions/button/>Button control</a>.</p></li><li><p>Create a table with two columns and call them <strong>ID</strong> and <strong>Name</strong>.

MySQL is a relational database management system (<strong>RDBMS</strong>) used to manage structured collections of data. This data can consist of anything from a simple to do list to a more complex organisation network. Using the MySQL server as your datasource, you can perform any Create, Read, Update and Delete (<strong>CRUD</strong>) operations using the <strong>Data</strong> rules provided in the Kianda platform, to learn more about data rules go to <a href=/docs/platform/rules/data/>Data rules</a>. Using the MySQL server connector, you have access to all tables within your database from your server, keep in mind that you can perform CRUD operations on data within a <strong>table</strong> of the database, but you <strong>cannot</strong> create or delete <strong>tables themselves</strong>.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>You can use the MySQL Server connector when you want <strong>access</strong> or <strong>modify</strong> data within a <strong>table</strong> in your MySQL server. You can connect the MySQL server connector to a <strong>List</strong> field as its datasource, meaning you can access information from a table and display the information that are stored in the table. For example if your MySQL server contains tables such as <strong>Employees</strong>, <strong>Purchases</strong> and <strong>Standing Orders</strong>, you will be able to connect the list field to one of those tables giving you CRUD access to its data.</p><p>Take a table <strong>Employees</strong> as an example, if this employee table contains data about the employees in your company such as name, phone number, email address and home address. You can <strong>create</strong> a new employee by providing necessary information, you can <strong>read</strong> (display) employee data, <strong>update</strong> employees information for example when a home address has changed and you can <strong>delete</strong> an employee from the table. Those are the CRUD operations you can perform on MySQL server through a process within Kianda.</p><h2 id=before-getting-started>Before getting started</h2><p>When establishing a connection using MySQL data connector, you are creating a connection with a <strong>Database</strong> from a server, not the <strong>server</strong> itself. Before continuing make sure that your MySQL server has a <strong>database</strong> you can connect to. A database can represent type of data you want to access and with in this database, you need to create a <strong>table</strong> representing the actual data you will have CRUD access to. For example creating a database of your company name such as <strong>GreenITR</strong>, and within this database you can create tables to represent your <strong>Employees</strong>, <strong>Purchases</strong> and <strong>Standing Orders</strong>.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol><li><p>From the Kianda home page, click on <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Data sources</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Click on <strong>+ Add new</strong> button <img src=/images/addnew.png alt="Add new data connector button"> and choose <strong>MySQL</strong> from the list of datasources provided.</p></li><li><p>Fill out fields in the <strong>MySQL Server details</strong> screen.</p><p><img src=/images/mysql-details.jpg alt="SQL Server details page"></p><p>Choose from the edit options:</p><ul><li><strong>Display name</strong> - type in the name for your MySQL server connector.

This is possible by creating a <strong>Process</strong> and scheduling it to run before the Access Token expires.</p><p><strong>How to get started</strong></p><p><strong>Create the datasource</strong></p><p>First you will need to create the <strong>datasource</strong>. For example, see a sample <strong>REST Service</strong> below with two <strong>REST Methods. The</strong> method titled <strong>Get/Refresh Auth Token</strong> is what will be used to refresh the Access Token with the scheduled task. For more information on how to create <strong>REST Services</strong> go to the <strong>REST Service</strong> page <em><strong>LINK</strong></em></p><p><img src=file:///C:/Users/CAITRI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.jpg alt=img></p><p><img src=file:///C:/Users/CAITRI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.jpg alt=img></p><p><strong>Create the process</strong></p><p>Next, the process to contain fields for the parameters for the request body and fields to hold the parameters from the response.</p><p>In the request body there are five parameters which need to be populated, the grant_type, client_id, client_secret, redirect_url and refresh token. Each of these parameters get a corresponding field.</p><p>In the response there are five fields as well, the Access token, Token type, expiry time, Refresh token and creation time. The only fields I require are the Access Token, expiry and creation times. Each field has a corresponding field.</p><p>Separately, I have gotten the Access Token so I can enter these details into the designer directly.</p><p><img src=file:///C:/Users/CAITRI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.jpg alt=img></p><p>Create a button called <strong>Refresh</strong>. Within this button there are three buttons.</p><p>\1. <strong>Set Form Field</strong> - Clear the Access Token field.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Create Item –</strong> This rule will invoke the REST Service and map the response back to the process.</p><p><strong>a.</strong> Click on the Select data source button. In the following dialog box select the <strong>Rest Service</strong> and select the <strong>Get/Refresh Auth Token REST Method.</strong></p><p><img src=file:///C:/Users/CAITRI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.jpg alt=img></p><p>b. In the Input mapping, map the values from the process into the request body. The left-hand column, Form field or text, represents the fields within the process or hard coded values. The right-hand column, Data source field, represent the values within the <strong>REST Service,</strong> be it the request header, request body, response header or response body**.** In addition to the parameters defined with the <strong>REST Service</strong> the <strong>urlPath</strong> can be defined in the process and passed into the datasource.</p><p><img src=file:///C:/Users/CAITRI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image010.jpg alt=img></p><p><img src=file:///C:/Users/CAITRI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image011.png alt=img></p><p>c. The On Success Mapping section is used to map the result from the API call back into the Process. The left-hand column, Form field or text, represents the fields within the process or hard coded values. The right-hand column, Data source field, represent the values within the <strong>REST Service,</strong> be it the request header, request body, response header or response body</p><p><img src=file:///C:/Users/CAITRI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.jpg alt=img></p><p>\3. The last rule must be a save rule.</p><p>Finally; run the Process in preview mode, ensure the details you want to pass into the <strong>REST Service</strong> are correct and save the process. Take note of the Process ID as this will be needed for setting up the Scheduled Task</p><p><strong>Create the Scheduled Task</strong></p><p>The final step will be to create the scheduled task that will run before the refresh token expires. Navigate to the <strong>Scheduled tasks</strong> within the <strong>Administration</strong> section in the site. Click on the <strong>Schedule a task</strong> button and fill in the dialog box.</p><p><img src=file:///C:/Users/CAITRI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image015.jpg alt=img></p><p>\1. Enter a name for the task in the <strong>Task Name</strong> field.</p><p>\2. Under <strong>Schedule</strong> select the <strong>Minutes</strong> option. In the <strong>Every</strong> <strong>Minutes</strong> field enter a numerical value. For example, if the Access Token expires every 60 minutes, enter 55, meaning the schedule will run every 55 minutes.</p><p>\3. Leave the <strong>Expire</strong> checkbox blank as this schedule should never stop.</p><p>\4. Under <strong>Process Design</strong> select the name of the process that you created in the step above. This will expose a new field called <strong>Select the field or rule to trigger on schedule.</strong></p><p>\5. In <strong>Process ID</strong> enter the ID of the process that you created in preview mode.</p><p>\6. In <strong>Select the field or rule to trigger on schedule</strong> select the <strong>Refresh</strong> button**.**</p><p><img src=file:///C:/Users/CAITRI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image017.jpg alt=img></p><p>\7. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save.</p><p>The Schedule is now set up and will refresh the access token as frequently as the time entered in the minutes field.</p><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>The Schedule is now set up and will refresh the access token as frequently as the time entered in the minutes field. This will run indefinitely until a user chooses to delete the schedule.</p><p>The datasource is now available to used and the Access Token is being kept current. The Access Token can be pulled into different <strong>Processes</strong> and used to send further <strong>REST APIs</strong>.

This could be useful, for example, for inspection reports where a report template can be used to show the information the engineer input to a <strong>Kianda form</strong> during his inspection. Each time an inspection is performed, a report is generated based on a Word template and the report shows the relevant information that was captured during that particular inspection.</p><p><em>Microsoft Word template with Kianda form fields</em></p><p><img src=/images/word-template.jpg alt="MS Word template containing Kianda form fields"></p><p>In the example above, a report will generate data pulled from a Kianda process instance (record) that contains the date, company and location data within an ‘Inspection Form’ and a ‘Request Form’.

The forms need to have different types of fields within them, for example a text box field or a table field. Those fields are used to create <strong>smart tags</strong> using the Kianda add-in within a Word or Excel template. Smart tags are created when a field is selected from a process using the Kianda add-in task pane, and then inserted into the document. See the image below for a presentation of a smart tag in Excel:</p><p><img src=/images/excel-add-in-smart-tag.jpg alt="Smart tag explanation"></p><p>Before you get started, you also need to have the outline of a template ready so that you can import data from your process by using the smart tags. For each instance of a process the smart tags will pull values from that a specific process instance, but the outline of the template will stay the same. For example, if you create a Health & Safety checklist process, the outline of the checklist is always the same but the values may differ for each time the checklist is filled out. A template outline represents the generic outline of what data will be needed in the final generated document, for example, you need the date, the company, location and relevant checks that need to be performed. See image below for an example of a template outline:</p><h6 id=heading><a href></a></h6><p><img src=/images/doc-gen-template-outline.jpg alt="Template outline"></p><p>We have briefly introduced the concept of document generation in Kianda.

This could be useful, for example, when performing a health & safety check on a building site. A template can be used by an inspector to have a <strong>generic outline</strong> of what needs to be completed when preforming the check. Each time a check is performed, the generated report may contain different data. This data is <strong>pulled</strong> directly from the each <strong>individual check</strong> when performed by an inspector.</p><h2 id=before-you-get-started>Before you get started</h2><p>In advance of creating a template, you need to install Kianda add-in for word.

Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> is the main interface for designing processes. Designer components are explained below.</p><h3 id=how-to-get-started-with-kianda-designer>How to get started with Kianda Designer</h3><p>The key components of the form designer are:</p><ol><li>Left panel</li><li>The central area is where the current <strong>form canvas</strong> is displayed.</li><li>The right panel is where the currently selected component <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>rules</strong> are displayed.</li></ol><p><em><strong>Form designer key components</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/form-designer.png alt="Form designer components"></p><h2 id=responsive-form-layout>Responsive form layout</h2><p>Form fields are made to with a mobile-first approach giving you design once and deploy everywhere opportunity.</p><p>By using the <strong>Layout</strong> option under the property panel you will be able to simply define the layout of your fields or panels within a form. Clicking on the <strong>^</strong> quickly uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.</p><p><img src=/images/layout-mode.png alt="Layout mode"></p><p>This allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows designing web interfaces with a mobile-first approach.</p><h2 id=forms--layout-fields>Forms & layout fields</h2><p>Kianda comes with several pre-defined field widgets. In case none of them satisfies your specific needs and if you have some level of <a href=development.md>development</a> skills you can always create your custom field widget.</p><p>At the time of writing, the default fields fall into four main categories of fields:</p><ol><li><strong>Input</strong> - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields.</li><li><strong>Layout</strong> - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields.</li><li><strong>Action</strong> - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components.</li><li><strong>Custom</strong> - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields available under your developer section.</li></ol><p>Layout fields take an important role when building a modern user interface and allow you to achieve the pixel perfect layout you want.</p><h3 id=model-dialogs>Model dialogs</h3><p>Model dialogs are a special form of layout fields. It allows a form designer to define an interface with the key intention of grabbing users attention to something important.</p><p>Typically we use dialogs for things like requiring user confirmation or to let them make a final decision.</p><p><em><strong>How to use a model dialog</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src="/videos/How to use a model dialog.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><p>On the example above, we use a modal dialog to display a simple <em>warning to the user</em>. The following are the steps:</p><ol><li>On the Layout components, select the <em>Dialog</em>.</li><li>Click on the dialog component to insert other fields within it.</li><li>You can add any field to your dialog, in this case, we are adding a Rich text.</li><li>To preview how your dialog box will be displayed, you can use the <strong>Preview</strong> button, on the dialog component.</li></ol><h3 id=forms>Forms</h3><p>Forms are an important component of any process, they might be used as stages of a process and could be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).</p><p>The key rules for working with forms are:</p><ol><li>Forms are assignable - means that only a form assignee can edit a particular form. This can be a combination of users and groups.</li><li>Only form owners can edit a given form by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</li><li>Multi-step processes use the concept of &ldquo;current form&rdquo;. Only the form matching the process status will be made editable.</li><li>In a multi-step process, other forms that are not &ldquo;current form&rdquo; can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form. Meaning they might also be editable and will form a form group.</li></ol><p>The rules above work together to determine if the form is in edit mode or display mode. Form designers have at their disposal <a href=business-rules.md>business rules</a> such as <em>assign form</em>, <em>go to form</em> and <em>submit rule</em> to dynamically control the ability for end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.</p><p><em><strong>How to add new form</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result back to the person that started the submission.</p><p>We have seen a few examples of how people use anonymous forms in Kianda. From simple feedback forms to GDPR data requests that hope between multi divisions before sending back a response to the requester with the level of information held by the organization.</p><p>Anonymous forms can be embedded in iframes and safely displayed within other web-based applications.</p><p>In Kianda there are effectively 2 types of anonymous forms</p><ul><li>New process anonymous form</li><li>Existing process anonymous form</li></ul><h3 id=new-instance-anonymous-form-url>New instance anonymous form URL</h3><p>To set up a globally available link for allowing external users to create a new instance, perform the following steps within the form designer:</p><ol><li>On the top right corner of the designer click on the settings button.</li><li>Then click the option &ldquo;Enable anonymous sharing of forms&rdquo; to Yes.</li><li>Click the button &ldquo;New Link&rdquo; to generate a new anonymous link.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/anonymous-forms.png alt="Anonymous Form Setting"></p><h3 id=existing-instance-anonymous-form-url>Existing instance anonymous form URL</h3><p>To setup existing instance anonymous form one needs to use the anonymous form rule to generate a new anonymous link at the runtime that will point to an existing process record that can then be shared with external users.</p><p>Note that for this to work steps 1 and 2 of New Instance Anonymous form is still required.</p><p>The following are some of the key options of the anonymous link rule:</p><ul><li>Form to share (any form within an existing process).</li><li>Link expires settings: Number of uses, time-based or never expire.</li><li>Message to display on submission.</li></ul><p><strong>Important</strong>: There can be only one active link of each type for a given process.

It is particularly useful in those situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.</p><p>Custom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. If you need to build &ldquo;an action&rdquo; then you should use a custom rule widget.</p><p>It allows a developer to build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes.</p><p>Check-out the <a href=development.md>development</a> section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.</p><h2 id=advanced-techniques>Advanced techniques</h2><p>Like the cascading dropdown discussed above, several other advanced scenarios can be easily configured in Kianda. Here is a short-list:</p><ul><li><strong>Repeating section</strong> - A repeating section can be created by adding a <strong>panel</strong> to a table field. This table can be configured to include a single column made of the panel that itself will include the repeating fields of your repeating section.</li><li><strong>The capture of media</strong> - Kianda enables mobile users to directly capture pictures, video or audio just like a native application.</li><li><strong>Background save</strong> - By making use of PWA principles (Progressive Web Application) Kianda allows the ability to perform background operations. This is useful when, for example, a mobile user picks-up their phone to perform a quick action and places it back in his pocket. Operations will continue in the background allowing all data to be captured.</li><li><strong>Image annotation</strong> - Kianda allows for image annotation online or offline.</li><li><strong>Multi-column / row layout</strong> - Making multi-column responsive interfaces is quite easy. Simply add two panels into a form that only use half of the screen (6 columns) then add fields inside panels and you have multiple column layouts. Adding a panel using 12 columns gives you a row.</li><li><strong>Form tab colour and icon</strong> - Form tabs can be quickly customised to display their icons or tab colours, it is also possible to define custom colours for selected and completed form tabs.</li><li><strong>Hide form tab and left nav</strong> - This is self-explanatory, yes you can hide the default navigation elements.</li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-e04b3662f527b448bdc4fbb13e8601a3>3.1 - Application layout</h1><p><em>As a driver of agile software development</em></p><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-d754f0bea6a937c812d8282e2ec155e1>3.2 - Configuration over customisation principle</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-8977ed83d537d9bc8cea70e1acc7de75>3.3 - Implementing dynamic logic with rules</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-aab0831564a6ffa72db0b9ba9960eb48>3.4 - No-Code application development life cycle</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-1b4d84bdfa59cae8718b1a398e13f3ba>3.5 - No-code design principles</h1><h2 id=getting-started-with-the-kianda-platform>Getting started with the Kianda platform</h2><p>The Kianda platform no-code / low-code (NCLC) platform is built with the ultimate flexibility and agility in mind.</p><p>At the software level Kianda follows an <strong>MVC approach</strong> (Model, View, Controller). This approach enabled the Kianda team to build a flexible way for designers to build mobile responsive applications by using <strong>rapid UI prototyping</strong> via drag & drop of forms and fields. This layout serves as the basis for defining the application or process schema and for capturing and reporting on data at run-time.</p><p>Some of the underlying technologies used within the platform include CSS3, HTML5, EmberJS, WebApi and NodeJS.</p><p>Using a MVC approach allows that data, captured within forms and fields, to instantly react or trigger declarative rules defined on fields, forms or at process level via the <strong>rules engine</strong>. This combined with conditional logic is used by designers to build ambitious progressive web applications or end-to-end digital business processes that offer both a great UI and high performance.</p><p><img src=/images/platform-areas.png alt="Platform areas"></p><blockquote><p>In Kianda one of the most important components that is worth emphasis is the <a href=/rules/><strong>rules engine</strong>.</a></p></blockquote><h3 id=in-a-nutshell-the-rules-engine-is-made-of>In a nutshell the <strong>rules-engine</strong> is made of:</h3><ol><li>Rule blocks - These are blocks that unlocks specific functionality using a toolkit approach</li><li>Flexible and declarative conditional logic</li></ol><p>These two components (rule blocks and conditional logic) are used extensively and recursively by designers to build the required orchestration of actions or rules that react of interact with data to provide the required functionality for your apps or processes.</p><p>In summary the Kianda platform provides an ideal interface for rapid prototyping and delivering outcomes quickly.</p><blockquote><h3 id=what-makes-kianda-great-is-the-simplicity-and-unbounded-flexibility-it-gives-citizen-developers-and-low-code-developers-alike>What makes Kianda great is the simplicity and unbounded flexibility it gives citizen developers and low-code developers alike</h3></blockquote><h3 id=table-of-contents>Table of contents</h3></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-4b4fe97efad5b595d35ef5d0b11f72a5>3.6 - No-Code Development Best Practices</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-529ab877bc340518d76c7b8617ea6132>3.7 - Process design vs instances</h1><div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary"><p>Page under construction</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-3382dba2deef6c64f63b9031834703f8>3.8 - Why choose no-code?</h1><p>Covering from document generation to task automation following industry best practices, the Kianda platform can deliver quickly amazing results to any digital project.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-0f5a3f5a02977986654eeb13c2532203>4 - What is Low-Code Development?</h1><p>Kianda comes with several pre-defined field, rule and dashboard widgets. In case you want to create something else to satisfy your specific needs you can create your own custom widget if you have some level of development skills. Kianda uses EmberJS to build modern web applications, and in particular the Handlebars templating library to power the application&rsquo;s user interface.</p><h2 id=emberjs-templating-basics>EmberJS templating basics</h2><p>With Handlebars you can quickly build web applications that are made up of different components. Handlebar templates contain static HTML and dynamic content inside Handlebars expressions, which are summoned with double curly braces: {{ }}</p><p>Dynamic content inside a Handlebars expression is rendered with data-binding. This means if you update a property, your usage of that property in a template will be automatically updated to the latest value.</p><h3 id=helpers>Helpers</h3><p>Ember gives the ability to write your helpers, to bring a minimum of logic into Ember templating. For example, let&rsquo;s say you would like the ability to add a few numbers together, without needing to define a computed property everywhere you would like to do so.</p><p><em><strong>Helper example</strong></em><img src=/images/write-our-own-helpers.png alt=Helpers></p><h4 id=conditionals>Conditionals</h4><p>Statements like <strong>if</strong> and <strong>unless</strong> are implemented as built-in helpers. Helpers can be invoked three ways; inline invocation, nested invocation and block invocation.

As the Kianda platform is a progressive web application, you can access your businesses&rsquo; Kianda workspace as if it were a mobile application.</p><p>Instead of having to download an application through your device&rsquo;s native application store, the PWA can be formatted and installed on your device so that you can easily access the website via a URL shortcut. This means with Kianda you get a digital experience that is native-like while maintaining online web benefits. When you have a Kianda subscription, you gain the ability to access your workspace via a PWA. Seen below is the accessing of the Kianda platform via a PWA on an android device.</p><p><img src=/videos/gifs/common/pwav2-gif-smaller.gif alt="PWA Gif"></p><h2 id=benefits>Benefits</h2><p>There are several benefits of using a PWA app when comparing to a web app or even a native only app.</p><h3 id=offline-use>Offline Use</h3><p>Apps keep working with or without network access, allowing for <strong>offline availability</strong> of resources. Even when your users are going through a tunnel or in a lift, changes are automatically queued offline and then <strong>synchronised</strong> when connectivity is restored. This can be extremely useful when completing process instances in remote locations, for example filling out an inspection form in an area with no internet coverage.</p><h3 id=fast-performance>Fast Performance</h3><p>The app loads quickly thanks to having it installed locally on your device. This provides you with an increased <strong>ease of access</strong> experience as you are not required to download the application via your device&rsquo;s native application store. Progressive web apps are faster because of the way the underlying technology <strong>caches</strong> and serves text, stylesheets, images and other content on the websites. As a result user experience, consistency and conversion rate increase.</p><h3 id=engaging>Engaging</h3><p>When installing on your home screen with your brand icons, users receive <strong>timely push notifications</strong> that help them stay engaged. If you would prefer to not receive notifications, you can disable them and relevant updates will be executed in the background silently.</p><h3 id=secure>Secure</h3><p>PWAs make use of <strong>HTTPS requests</strong> to transfer data, which minimises potential security threats. As these applications access your Kianda workspace through your chosen web browser, PWAs utilise the added security features of these web browsers such as <strong>SSL encryption</strong>.</p><h3 id=responsive>Responsive</h3><p>The Kianda platform is designed to be responsive on a myriad of mobile devices which reduces any future developmental costs. PWAs employ the <strong>adaptive</strong> nature of HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that your Kianda workspace will consistently maintain a neat display of features.</p><h2 id=installing-your-pwa-on-a-mobile>Installing your PWA on a mobile</h2><p>There are a few options to install your Kianda PWA workspace into mobile devices. The quickest is to let your users manually use the option <strong>Add to Home screen</strong> in their mobile devices.</p><h3 id=android>Android</h3><p>The primary method for android users to install the PWA onto their device is by:</p><ol><li><p>Navigate to <em><strong>https://&lt;businessName>.kianda.com</strong></em> via your chosen web browser application.</p></li><li><p>On the platform login screen, you will be prompted to install the PWA by clicking on the <strong>Add <em>[Business Name]</em></strong> <strong>to Home screen</strong>.

However if these do not suit, then Kianda’s low-code development solution provides near limitless room for process expansion. As the Kianda platform offers access to any data source (including real-time synchronisation of the data) and integration with many other software tools and applications, the implementation of low-code can provide your business processes with extreme scalability and room for improvement.</p><p>You can also build upon pre-defined field, rule and dashboard code to offer the developer a shortcut in creating something new and beneficial for the organisation.

However as a workspace <strong>Administrator</strong> you can add a <strong>Global CSS File</strong> to make changes to the look and feel of the site as well as processes. The <strong>Global CSS file editor</strong> exists within the <strong>Look and Feel</strong> section of the Subscription, within the <strong>Administration</strong> section of the site, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/subscription/>Subscription</a> for an introduction to the <strong>Subscription</strong> function.</p><h2 id=when-to-use>When to use</h2><p>Remember the visual style of processes and individual controls like buttons, can be heavily customised using Kianda <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/designer/><strong>Designer</strong></a> to achieve a unique look that is both appealing to the eye and practical. Many of these changes can be achieved simply by using the provided customisation controls within <strong>Designer</strong>, for example selecting a button, and clicking on the <strong>Edit/pen</strong> icon to make changes.</p><p><img src=/images/button-example.jpg alt="Selected button example"></p><p>Selecting the button in this way to edit it, will allow you to select the colour scheme of the control and assign an icon to it from a large library of available icons.</p><p>However, you may want to achieve a <strong>deeper level of customisation</strong>. There are several methods available to combine practicality and ease of user with an aesthetically pleasing design. One option is to modify the <strong>Global CSS File</strong> when you want to change the look and feel of the <strong>site or your processes</strong>. You can do this by selecting individual fields in the <strong>process</strong> via the unique name or can change entire elements by selecting their element name or a selector. Once items are added to the file they will be available globally in the <strong>Subscription</strong> function within <strong>Administration</strong>.</p><h2 id=before-you-get-started>Before you get started</h2><p>The key to building functional and aesthetically pleasing workspaces and processes within Kianda is to <strong>plan ahead</strong> and create a design in advance that you can then use as your vision and mould your process or workspace into. <strong>Design</strong> <strong>tools</strong> can be used to create <strong>visual</strong> <strong>mock</strong>-<strong>ups</strong> of the processes and workspaces you would like to create, for example the mock-up below was created using <strong>Adobe</strong> <strong>XD</strong>.</p><img src=/images/mock-up-design.jpg alt="Mock-up design example" style=zoom:80%><p>Bootstrap has released a <strong>library</strong> that can be imported into Adobe XD that allows you to create designs using <strong>bootstrap</strong> <strong>elements</strong>. This allows you to see all of the <strong>available</strong> <strong>components</strong> you have to create your processes and workspaces, and then create <strong>visually</strong> <strong>pleasing</strong> and <strong>functional</strong> <strong>designs</strong> using these elements.</p><p>The <strong>mock</strong>-<strong>up</strong> was then used as a plan to <strong>create</strong> <strong>this</strong> <strong>process</strong>. You don’t have to create processes or workspaces exactly the same as the mock-ups to create during the <strong>planning</strong> <strong>stage</strong>, but they act as a great <strong>reference</strong> and allow you to have a <strong>solid</strong> <strong>foundation</strong> to build off of whilst still being able to <strong>deviate</strong> from the <strong>design</strong> when the need arises. Go to <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/>Create your first Kianda process</a> for advice and tips on planning processes. To help you in planning your CSS design, see the sections below.</p><h3 id=effective-use-of-css-classes>Effective use of CSS classes</h3><p>Although you may be familiar with the concept of using <strong>CSS</strong> <strong>classes</strong> to apply styling to several methods, you may not be familiar with the concept of using the <strong>name</strong> <strong>field</strong> of a Kianda element to <strong>instantly</strong> <strong>apply</strong> <strong>styes</strong> to that element that you have already developed.

A <strong>webhook</strong> or web <strong>callback</strong> allows information to be pushed from Kianda to your applications in real time when <strong>process instances are created, deleted or updated</strong>. This provides an efficient way to execute event reactions, thereby eliminating the need to continuously poll for data.</p><p>The Kianda <strong>webhooks</strong> function allows you to configure URLs that can respond to process instance creation, deletion and update events. When these events happen, the webhook will then make a HTTP request to your application, including variables like the process instance name, querying the provided URL, so your application can be updated.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Callback has a timeout of 10 seconds.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>You must have an <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Developer</strong> role see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/users/>Users & Groups</a> for more details on roles. Then to get started with webhooks:</p><ol><li><p>Navigate to <strong>Administration</strong> in the left-hand side menu, and click on <strong>Developer</strong>. This will bring you to the <strong>Developer resources</strong> page.</p><p><em><strong>Developer resources page</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/widgetview2.jpg alt="Widget view"></p></li><li><p>Click on <strong>Webhooks</strong> to create a process instance callback.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Instance Callback URLs</strong> dialog box appears.</p><p><img src=/images/webhooks50.gif alt=Webhooks></p></li><li><p>Use the slider to turn on the relevant callback:</p><ul><li><strong>Enable Created Callback</strong> - this will enable a URL callback every time a process instance is <strong>updated</strong>. This results in a <strong>HTTP GET request</strong> with parameters <code>instanceID={instanceID}, processName={processName}</code> and <strong><code>eventType=created</code></strong> being issued to the given URL.</li><li><strong>Enable Updated Callback</strong> - this will enable a URL callback every time a process instance is <strong>updated</strong>. This results in a <strong>HTTP GET request</strong> with parameters <code>instanceID={instanceID}, processName={processName}</code> and <strong><code>eventType=updated</code></strong> being issued to the given URL.</li><li><strong>Enable Deleted Callback</strong> - this will enable a URL callback every time a process instance is <strong>deleted</strong>. This results in a <strong>HTTP GET request</strong> with parameters <code>instanceID={instanceID}, processName={processName}</code> and <strong><code>eventType=deleted</code></strong> being issued to the given URL.</li></ul></li><li><p>In each case <strong>type in the URL</strong> to respond to process instance create, update and deleted events.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <strong>Help</strong> button <img src=/images/webhookhelp.PNG alt="Help button"> for clarification.</p></li><li><p>Click on <strong>OK</strong> when done or click on <strong>Close</strong> at any stage to close the dialog box.</p></li></ol><h2 id=whats-next-idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h2><p>To continue with low-code development, you can view <a href=/docs/low-code/templating-basics/>Templating basics</a>.

Ember UIs use HTML meaning that everything you see on screen in Kianda is defined in a HTML template somewhere within the Kianda application. Ember allows you <strong>inspect components</strong> found in <a href=docs/platform/application-designer/forms/>Kianda forms</a> on screen for example a button, a rule, a panel and so on. You can use this knowledge to create your own rule, field, dashboard and data connector widgets.</p><p>To get the make the most out of your Kianda customisation we recommend installing and using the <strong>Ember inspector</strong> to help you understand what Kianda components are available, what their properties are and how they are used. The next section details how you can get started with Ember.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started-with-ember-inspector>How to get started with Ember Inspector</h2><p>The Ember inspector is a Chrome plug-in that allows you to investigate and understand your Ember.js. This browser add-on can be installed on Google Chrome, Firefox and other browsers. For example to install the add-on in Chrome, go to the Chrome web store, search for &lsquo;Ember inspector&rsquo; and then in the search results click on the add-on and <strong>Add to Chrome</strong>.</p><p>To get started using the Ember inspector:</p><ol><li><p>Click on <strong>Add extension</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Open your Kianda workspace, for example <a href=https://your-organisation.kianda.com>https://your-organisation.kianda.com</a></p></li><li><p>Log in to Kianda, then navigate to a form, and open the Ember inspector by right-clicking on a page for example in Google Chrome and click on <strong>Inspect</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Then click on the <strong>Ember</strong> tab.</p></li><li><p>In the left-hand pane you will see <strong>Components</strong>, <strong>View Tree</strong>, <strong>Routes</strong>, <strong>Data</strong> and <strong>Depreciations</strong> amongst other options.</p></li><li><p>In the central pane you can drill down to a particular component, for example, in the form below, a <strong>Hide or disable rule</strong> is about to be added. You can see what the components are within this modal/edit rule dialog box by scrolling over the components in the central pane.</p><p><img src=/images/ember-rule-editor.jpg alt="Inspecting a rule modal using Ember inspector"></p><p>By highlighting the <strong>rule editor component</strong> we can see the template used appear on screen.</p></li><li><p>If you click on the component itself, then the properties of that component appear in the right-hand pane. For example the properties of a field-picker component are seen in the image below.</p><p><img src=/images/ember-properties-example.jpg alt="Component properties in Ember inspector"></p><p>In this way you can view all the components within Kianda and the properties associated, for example by default the field-picker component used in the modal in step 6 has a property &lsquo;allowText&rsquo; false, that is text is not typed in but the user chooses form elements from a drop-down list.</p><p><img src=/images/field-picker-example.jpg alt="Field picker example"></p></li><li><p>To read more about Ember.js go to <a href=https://guides.emberjs.com/release/>https://guides.emberjs.com/release/</a> in particular the <a href=https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/>Components pages</a> as well as other <strong>Core concepts</strong>.</p></li></ol></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-3ed42a366033a73c16952def2baeb723>5 - How to videos</h1></div><div class=td-content><h1 id=pg-b1f58797307eb8d259563bc5fae8d020>5.1 - Adding rules to a process</h1><div class=lead>Learn how to add a rule into a process in Kianda</div><p>This video introduces Kianda rules and demonstrates how to add a Send email Communications rule to a form.</p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

Security refers to both access to processes as a Designer, and access to process instances.</p><h2 id=security-privileges-by-role>Security privileges by role</h2><p>The Kianda platform allows for <strong>different security privileges to be set for different types of users</strong>, making administration of users and their access rights easy to manage. The following are <strong>the different roles</strong> users can be assigned on Kianda – each has certain <strong>default permissions</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>User</strong> – can only access what is assigned to them. For example, forms and dashboards.</li><li><strong>Administrator</strong> – can access (view and edit) all published processes. Can only edit draft processes that they have created themselves or for which they have been made Process Administrators.</li><li><strong>Manage partners/customers</strong> – can only access the essentials to manage customer portals; that is, they can use the Invite partners function under the Administration menu.</li><li><strong>Design business process</strong> – can only design business forms and workflows using Kianda Designer</li><li><strong>Manage data sources</strong> – can only manage data sources and connections, namely the Data sources function</li><li><strong>Developer</strong> – can design new widgets within the platform using the Developer function</li></ul><p>In addition to default permissions, you can also create user groups and assign ownership and/or access to processes or dashboards as needed. Security settings can be applied to dashboards or particular widgets within a dashboard so that they are only visible to certain users or groups of users; and data source connections can be configured in the same way to ensure the highest access control levels. We will now look at different ways of assigning access and controlling security.</p><h2 id=process-administrators>Process administrators</h2><p>When an <strong>Administrator</strong> creates a new process in Kianda, they can set who they want the <strong>Process Administrators</strong> of that process to be (anyone chosen to be a Process Administrator needs to be someone who has an Administrator role, so that they have access to the Designer function to be able to edit the process). The <strong>Process Administrators</strong> can be individual users, groups or a combination of the two.</p><p>If you are an Administrator, you can edit a process you have created and set the Administrator role for that process by clicking on the <strong>Edit process</strong> button (Pen icon) in the main process view. Choose the user(s) and/or groups you want to be the Process Administrator(s) in the Edit process dialog box.</p><p><em>Setting process administrators in the Edit process dialog box</em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/process-administrator.gif alt=img></p><p>In the example above, Vikky was already a Workspace Administrator who had access to the Designer function in Kianda – now that she has been assigned to be the Process Administrator for the Maintenance Process, this means that she <strong>can edit the draft process design</strong>.</p><h2 id=form-ownership>Form ownership</h2><p>When you create a process in Kianda, you can then set a <strong>default owner</strong> for each form you create within that process. Only Form Owners can <strong>edit individual</strong> <strong>process records</strong>. For example, if a ‘Maintenance Request Process’ is initiated from a dashboard, then the default Form Owner, regardless of their role (that is, regardless of whether their ‘role’ on Kianda is ‘administrator’ or ‘user’ etc), will be able to edit information submitted in new process records from that form.</p><p>If you are a Workspace Administrator and you’ve created a new process that contains a form, you can set the default owner for that form by opening the process in Kianda Designer, selecting the form and clicking the Edit form button (Pen icon). This opens the <strong>Edit form</strong> dialog box within which you can choose from individual users, groups or a combination of both under <strong>Default owner(s)</strong>.</p><h3 id=quick-actions-within-forms>Quick actions within forms</h3><p>Within the <strong>Edit form</strong> dialog box, you can select the <strong>Enable quick actions</strong> checkbox so that options to <strong>Enable re-assign</strong>, <strong>Enable edit</strong> and <strong>Enable custom action</strong> appear. From here, a Process Administrator or form designer can give individuals, groups or a combination of both, the ability to have <strong>process instances</strong> assigned to them, to enable them to <strong>edit</strong> <strong>in process records</strong> and <strong>custom actions</strong> of their choice.</p><p><em>Edit form dialog box</em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/edit-form-dialog-box.gif alt=img></p><p>Select the <strong>Enable quick actions</strong> checkbox, then select one or more of the checkboxes for the three options that appear below it (as shown in the image).

The following sections describe security at different levels.</p><h2 id=process-security-settings>Process security settings</h2><p>When you are creating or editing a process in Kianda Designer, you can set security settings for that process. This setting will <strong>apply to every record (instance)</strong> created from that process. To do this, click on the process in Designer and then, in the right-hand pane, click on the <strong>Settings</strong> button <img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/settings.png alt="Process settings button"> and select the checkbox beside <strong>Enable process security.</strong></p><p>Choose an individual user, groups or partner or combination, to be ‘security users’ and then choose from one of three security modes, as shown in here.</p><p><em>Process security settings</em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/process-security-settings.gif alt=img></p><p>The three available security levels are listed from lowest to highest. For example, if you choose <strong>Security users only can create, view and update</strong> means that only the users listed as <strong>Process security users</strong> – in the example shown here, Mike Balcoome and the Management Team – will be able to access and view process records. No other users will have access to the process records generated by this process.</p><h2 id=process-security-rule>Process security rule</h2><p>Another way to set security is to use one of the <strong>Workflow</strong> rules called <strong>Process security</strong> to <strong>dynamically change</strong> the security settings for a process record (instance). Using this rule allows you to set the same security modes shown in the process settings above, but this can happen based on a particular condition or trigger – for example, clicking the Submit button.</p><p>To add this rule, open your process in Kianda Designer and select the relevant form. Then, in the left-hand pane, go to <strong>Add a rule</strong> > <strong>Workflow</strong> > <strong>Process security</strong>. In the Edit rule – Process security dialog box, create a condition if desired, and then choose from the type of users who will become security users. Choose from the options: <strong>Override</strong> to override existing security, or <strong>Append</strong> if you want to add a new level of access. Click the <strong>Enable security</strong> checkbox to choose a Process security mode.</p><p><em>Edit rule – Process security dialog box</em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/security-rule.jpg alt=img></p><h2 id=panel-and-button-security>Panel and button security</h2><p>In addition to process and form level security, you can set panel and button security by clicking on a panel or button within a form. Click on the panel or button of choice, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button (Pen icon) and choose <strong>Yes</strong> beside <strong>Enable security</strong>. Click on the <strong>Add security</strong> button to add users or groups to enable access to the button or panel.</p><p><em>Panel security within the edit field dialog box</em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/panel-security.jpg alt=img></p><h2 id=dashboard-security>Dashboard security</h2><p>As an end user, when you login to Kianda, you are presented with dashboards and widgets for different processes. The dashboard is made of multiple widgets like tiles, charts, links and lists. Go to <a href=/docs/platform/pages/>Dashboard</a> to find out more about each widget type. You can set security at both a) dashboard level and b) widget level, see <a href=#widget-security>Widget security</a> for more details. This section will deal with dashboard level security.</p><p>Dashboard level security can only be applied if you have the <strong>Administrator</strong> role to allow visibility of <strong>dashboards and widgets.</strong></p><p>To apply security to dashboards:</p><ol><li><p>Go to the existing dashboard page by clicking on <strong>Dashboard</strong> and the page name in the left-hand side menu.</p></li><li><p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button <img src=/images/edit.png alt="Edit button"> visible in the top menu bar.</p></li><li><p>Now in <strong>Edit mode</strong>, the <strong>Settings</strong> button <img src=/images/settings2.png alt="Settings button"> is visible.

For example data could be submitted by a user in Australia to a cloud application, but the servers that hold and process the data are in Europe, so the data residency in this case refers to the European location.</p><p>Data residency is particularly important to ensure that local laws and regulations are upheld in the country/region where the data <strong>resides</strong>. It is therefore important that customers using cloud applications are aware of their data&rsquo;s physical location so that local laws are upheld. Knowing where a cloud provider&rsquo;s data centres are will help to ensure that organisational data residency policies respect local laws.</p><p>The Kianda platform is a <strong>SaaS (Software as a Service) cloud-based</strong> solution, and allows for integration to multiple third-party IT systems / siloed data sources, for example SharePoint Online Environment and Active Directory, SAP, SQL Server, O365, Oracle and so on. The platform is hosted and secured in <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>. This allows Kianda to specify the region where customer data will be stored and processed. The datacenter region for Kianda is North Europe, and therefore the location for data storage and processing is Ireland, see <a href=https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/data-residency/#select-geography>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/data-residency/#select-geography</a>. This means that data residency for Kianda, is Europe, and therefore European laws like General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) must be upheld.</p><h2 id=kianda-security-and-gdpr>Kianda Security and GDPR</h2><p>Kianda Technologies confirm that the data for Kianda Platform (including backup and test data) are stored within the EU. For optimal performance our platform is deployed to Microsoft Azure Ireland with geo replication to Azure Netherlands.</p><p>The Kianda platform is also available to be deployed and hosted on private cloud or on premises in client’s preferred geographical location. This setup will include its own backup policy and system. Our platform allows for data, including backup and test data, to be stored wherever it is most desirable for the Client for example SharePoint tenant.</p><p>Users’ IP addresses are stored in system logs for security and data protection purposes. We comply with our obligations under Data Protection Legislation by providing an adequate level of protection to any Personal Data.</p><p>In addition, the data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Data records are also masked from a GDPR point of view. We employ Microsoft security products to mask automatically, classify personal data which is scheduled on a weekly basis.</p><p>Personal data such as IP addresses is retained for a period of 12 months.</p><h3 id=iso270012013-certification>ISO27001:2013 Certification</h3><p>In terms of security and quality, all Kianda services and solutions are <strong>ISO27001:2013 Certified</strong>, and as part of that are audited by an external party every 6 months.

We provide separate production and test environments. Responsibility for maintaining test data is with data controllers, and in that regard, we treat both test and production environments as managed by the customer.</p><p>On termination of contract, as per our customer service level agreement we will destroy or otherwise dispose of any customer data in our possession unless we receive, no later than ten days after the effective date of the termination of this agreement, a written request for the delivery to the customer of the then most recent back-up of the customer data. We shall use reasonable commercial endeavours to deliver the back-up to the customer within 30 days of our receipt of such a written request, provided that the customer has, at that time, paid all fees and charges outstanding at and resulting from termination (whether or not due at the date of termination).</p><p>The Customer (data controller) shall own all right, title and interest in and to all of the Customer Data and shall have sole responsibility for the legality, reliability, integrity, accuracy and quality of all such Customer Data.</p><p>If we, as data processor, receive any request by any person to access all data, we shall within five (5) business days provide the Data Controller with the full details of that request.</p><p>Kianda would be pleased to participate in a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) at the client’s request.

It is a framework that uses industry-standard protocol for authorisation which focuses on simplifying client developer practices, while providing specific authorisation flows for applications. <strong>OAuth 2.0</strong> framework uses <strong>Bearer</strong> type tokens to authorise access to the platform for individual users. This token is required by Kianda to preform any <strong>Create, Read, Update and Delete</strong> (CRUD) requests to the <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong> (API).</p><p>When working within Kianda, there is no need for the Bearer token when making API requests during widget, rule or field creation because the Bearer token is already retrieved from the user being logged in. If you may want to create an application outside of Kianda however, this Bearer token needs to be provided for any CRUD operations to the API. There are two ways for retrieving the Bearer token:</p><h3 id=retrieving-bearer-token-using-a-get-request>Retrieving Bearer token using a GET request</h3><p>To retrieve your token you need to make the a <strong>GET</strong> request looking like <code>https://domain.com/token</code> where the domain is your company&rsquo;s, for example <code>https://green-itr.kianda.com/token</code> . For the request to be valid, you need to pass the following parameters to the header of the request:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left><code>username:</code></td><td>your Kianda username</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><code>password:</code></td><td>your Kianda password</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><code>scope:</code></td><td>your Kianda subscription ID</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><code>grant_type:</code></td><td><code>password</code></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left><code>remember:</code></td><td><code>yes</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can obtain the <code>scope</code> value by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Subscription</strong> > <strong>Subscription Details</strong> > <strong>Subscription Id</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/subscription-details.jpg alt="Subscription Id"></p><h3 id=retrieving-bearer-token-using-devtools>Retrieving Bearer token using devtools</h3><p>To retrieve your Bearer token using devtools, first you need to log into Kianda.
