Processes can connect to your data sources like Sharepoint or SalesForce allowing for the flexibility of your applications to grow as your business grows.</p><p>Each process can be linked to <strong>dashboards</strong> so you can see at a glance, for example, how many leave requests were submitted, purchase orders approved and so on. And you can customise all of these processes the way you want.</p><p>Before you begin, we at Kianda recommend doing some simple planning before you design your process.

To read more about process instances and settings go to the links below:</p></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-60eb5e695513b9a33c8bb16760f82262>1 - Process instance</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Kianda processes are made up of <strong>forms</strong>, which in turn contain <strong>fields</strong> or <strong>controls</strong> and <strong>rules</strong>. Fields are used to take in user input, make calculations, display values and so on, and rules are used to execute actions to drive the process.</p><p><strong>Kianda Designer</strong> is used to create these forms and form elements within a process. Each process in Kianda Designer will have itâ€™s own unique link or URL and this can be shared with other form designers for co-creation, for example, for a process named â€˜Training processâ€™ the link is:</p><p><a href=https://green-itr.kianda.com/admin/designer/training-process>https://green-itr.kianda.com/admin/designer/training-process</a></p><h2 id=process-instances>Process instances</h2><p>When your process is created in Kianda Designer, you can save the process, and then <strong>submit data</strong> to that process. When you save or submit data, then an <strong>instance</strong> of the process is created. Another name for a process instance is a <strong>record</strong>. This instance is tied to user data or calculated values, or to whatever the process is designed to do.</p><p>The instance has a unique ID which can be seen in a list widget in a <strong>dashboard</strong>. For example, this List widget displays the individual records of various training requests submitted by employees. The unique ID for each record is shown in the first column. Form owners or those with security access can click on ID â€˜training-request-and-feedback-process-26â€™ to view the training request form completed and submitted by employee Mark Donnelli.</p><p><em><strong>List widget in a dashboard showing process instances</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/process-instance.jpg alt="Process instance example"></p><p>This means that each new record generated by a process will have its own unique URL that can be shared with those who have the required security access and need to be involved in that <strong>particular process instance</strong>. For example, in this case, the training request submitted by Mark (an employee) may be viewed and approved by his line manager:</p><p><a href=https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/training-request-and-feedback-process-26>https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/training-request-and-feedback-process-26</a></p><p>You can create a link on your dashboard â€“ in the example shown above, the <strong>Start new process</strong> button at the top right of the Training Requests list widget â€“ that enables you to create a <strong>new record</strong> by bringing you into the relevant form. For information on creating list widgets go to <a href=docs/platform/pages/list/>List widget</a>.</p><p>If you commit to the process by <strong>submitting or saving information</strong>, then the result is a new process instance â€“ that is, a new unique record â€“ which will be seen in a list widget in the dashboard, as seen in the image above.</p><p>Keeping in mind that Designer is used to create processes, and that each â€˜runâ€™ of the process design results in a unique process instance or record, will help you later on when designing forms and dashboards.

The fields you add in, such as a text box, list or button are called <strong>Design fields</strong>. For example as seen in <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/process/properties/#field-properties>Field properties</a> you can change properties for a textbox field, like making the field <strong>Required</strong> and <strong>Visible</strong> for form users as shown in the image below for the Training Request form field called &lsquo;Employee Name&rsquo;</p><p><img src=/images/settingsprocess.png alt=.></p><p>These design fields are also apparent when creating <strong>dashboards</strong>, for example <strong>list</strong> widgets. In the example below we can see the <strong>Design fields</strong> highlighted that are found in the Training Request form. These highlighted fields like <strong>Employee Name</strong> will appear in the list widget in the dashboard.</p><p><img src=/images/design-fields-example.jpg alt="Example of design fields in a list widget"></p><p>Clicking on <strong>List fields</strong> in list widget shown above will <strong>show all the fields</strong> that will appear in the widget.</p><p><img src=/images/list-field-defaults.jpg alt="List field example"></p><p>Note that non Design fields are also included in the fields to display, namely <strong>ID</strong>, <strong>Process Name</strong> and <strong>Modified</strong> fields. These fields are part of the set of <strong>Common fields</strong> associated with all Kianda processes.</p><h2 id=common-fields>Common fields</h2><p>The non-design fields associated with all Kianda processes are listed below. It is useful to keep these fields in mind when designing forms, as they can be used to retrieve, store or display values from <strong>process instances</strong> for example <strong>Status</strong> which is the status of a process instance. Using these &lsquo;internal values&rsquo; could be useful where the status of one process could be used as a condition to trigger the start of another process, for example using the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/start-a-process/><strong>Start a process</strong></a> rule.</p><p>The common fields associated with process instances are:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Field name</th><th>Explanation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>ID</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>process instance ID</strong>, labelled as &lsquo;process-name-number&rsquo;, for example &lsquo;safety-inspection-8&rsquo;. This ID is part of the URL that brings you to the process instance/record held on the system when information is either submitted or saved. For example clicking on the process instance ID &lsquo;safety-inspection-8&rsquo; in a dashboard brings you to the form for example &lsquo;<a href="https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/safety-inspection-8'">https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/safety-inspection-8'</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Unique ID</strong></td><td>This is a <strong>system generated ID</strong> for each process instance, a 32 letter and number generated value.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Status</strong></td><td>This is the status for the process instance, that is either a &lsquo;<strong>form name</strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<strong>Completed</strong>&rsquo;. Completed indicates that all forms in a process have been submitted, while &lsquo;form name&rsquo; indicates what the active form is in the process, that is, where the process is &lsquo;at&rsquo;. For example in a process of two forms, a Request form and an Approval form. Once the Request form has been submitted then the status for a process is &lsquo;Approval form&rsquo; indicating that this form needs to be completed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Version</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>process instance version number</strong> that starts as 1.0. If a process instance is updated, for example if a process design is updated and published and process instances are updated with the change, then the next version of the instance will be 2.0.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Process Version</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>process design version</strong>, that is the version of the process design that has been used as a template for the process instance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Process Name</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>Unique ID name</strong> that comes from the process design that is the template for the process instance. The ID is created when the process is created. The ID field autofills from the title of the process as shown in <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/#creating-your-first-process>Create your first process</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Process Title</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>Process title</strong> that comes from the process design title, created when the process is created or updated, for example see <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/#creating-your-first-process>Create your first process</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Created</strong></td><td>This is a <strong>date and time stamp</strong> when the process instance is created.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Created by</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>user name</strong> of the user who <strong>created</strong> the process instance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Modified</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>date and time stamp</strong> when the process instance is modified, for example after a process design is published and existing process instances are updated.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Modified by</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>user name</strong> of the user who <strong>modified</strong> the process instance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Assign to</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>user name</strong> of the user who a process is <strong>assigned</strong> to. Process designs may have a static option for reassignment in their design so that process instances can be reassigned using <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/#how-to-get-started>Quick actions</a>. Alternatively the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> rule can be used to dynamically assign form ownership to another user. That user is named in the <strong>Assign to</strong> field.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Security users</strong></td><td>These are the named security users, defined using <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/process/settings/#process-settings><strong>Process settings</strong></a> by selecting <strong>Enable process security</strong> and naming <strong>Process security users</strong> which can be <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> and/or <strong>Partners</strong>.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><ul><li>To learn more about design controls that can be applied to forms go to <a href=/docs/platform/controls/><strong>Controls</strong></a>.</li><li>To learn more about how common fields are displayed in dashboards in a list widget go to <a href=/docs/platform/pages/list/><strong>List widget</strong></a>.</li></ul></div></main></div></div><footer class="bg-dark py-5 row d-print-none"><div class="container-fluid mx-sm-5"><div class=row><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-xs-center order-sm-2"><ul class="list-inline mb-0"><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Twitter aria-label=Twitter><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://twitter.com/kiandaBPM aria-label=Twitter><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-right text-xs-center order-sm-3"><ul class="list-inline mb-0"><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=GitHub aria-label=GitHub><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://github.com/kiandaBPM aria-label=GitHub><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></li><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Discord aria-label=Discord><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://discord.gg/uDSW6qcYub aria-label=Discord><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="col-12 col-sm-4 text-center py-2 order-sm-2"><small class=text-white>&copy; 2023 Kianda Technologies All Rights Reserved</small>
