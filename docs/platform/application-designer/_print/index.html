Forms can connect to any number of <strong>data sources</strong> or connectors at the same time. The form might be a simple contact form or something else more complex, and you can add more forms like &ldquo;Follow-up form&rdquo; or even a &ldquo;Closure form&rdquo;.</p><p>Although Kianda aims to be intuitive and easy to get started, it is never difficult to over-engineer. So at Kianda we always recommend doing some simple planning before you design your first form. It could be something as simple as a quick flow chart or a spreadsheet where you can quickly log the key components, fields or rules that are needed in the process.</p><p>In general there are three key steps to build a process in an agile manner:</p><ol><li><strong>Plan</strong> process design, forms, fields, rules, log into design spreadsheet.</li><li><strong>Build</strong> forms and fields connecting to data where applicable.</li><li><strong>Publish</strong> to dashboards, launch anonymous forms or publish to data sources for end-user distribution.</li></ol><p><em><strong>Platform getting started video</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src=/videos/Kianda-get-started.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=kianda-designer-introduction>Kianda Designer Introduction</h2><p>Kianda process designer provides an intuitive interface where you can quickly start building forms for any use case.</p><p>The key components of the form designer are:</p><ol><li>Left side panel containing both <strong>controls</strong> and <strong>rules</strong> that can be added to forms.</li><li>The central area is where the current <strong>form canvas</strong> is displayed.</li><li>The right panel is where the currently selected component <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>rules</strong> are displayed.</li></ol><p><em><strong>Form designer key components</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/form-designer.png alt="Form designer components"></p><p>The following headings highlight the key features of Designer that allow you to build slick, progressive, responsive and customised forms and processes.</p><h2 id=forms>Forms</h2><p>Forms are an important component of any process, they might be used as stages of a process and could be made active individually or at the same time known as <strong>parallel</strong> forms.</p><p>The key rules related to designing forms for user interaction are:</p><ol><li>Forms are <strong>assignable</strong>, this means that <strong>only a form assignee can edit</strong> a particular form in a process instance. The form assignee can be a combination of users and groups.</li><li>When a form is created, as a designer you can configure form owners. <strong>Only form owners can edit</strong> a given form in a process instance by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</li><li>Processes that have several steps or multi-step processes use the concept of <strong>current form</strong>. Only the form matching the process status will be made editable.</li><li>In a multi-step process, other forms that are not &ldquo;current form&rdquo; can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form. Meaning they might also be editable and will form a form group.</li></ol><p>The rules above work together to determine if the form is in edit mode or display mode. Form designers have at their disposal <a href=business-rules.md>business rules</a> such as <em>assign form</em>, <em>go to form</em> and <em>submit rule</em> to dynamically control the ability for end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.</p><p><em><strong>How to add new form</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src="/videos/How to add new form 2.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><ol><li>Click on <em>Add form</em>, on the top right side of the page.</li><li>Give your form a title.</li><li>The <em>name</em> is a unique identifier - you can leave it as it is.</li><li>You can define an owner to the form.</li><li>Activate with will decide when the form will be active - if you leave it blank, the new form will be activated <em>sequentially</em> after the first form is submitted.</li><li>Select <em>Submit mode</em> - you can submit just the current form or all forms that are in edit mode.</li><li>Check <em>Enable quick actions</em> if you want the form to be edited or re-assigned.</li><li>Provide a user or group in the <em>Quick action user (s)</em> to whom you would like to permit to re-assign or edit the form.</li></ol><h2 id=anonymous-forms>Anonymous Forms</h2><p>Anonymous forms are a great way of allowing people outside of your organisation to interact with your processes.</p><p>It could be something as simple as a contact form or a feedback form but as we all know a contact form never ends with the contact submission. There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result back to the person that started the submission.</p><p>We have seen a few examples of how people use anonymous forms in Kianda. From simple feedback forms to GDPR data requests that hope between multi divisions before sending back a response to the requester with the level of information held by the organization.</p><p>Anonymous forms can be embedded in iframes and safely displayed within other web-based applications.</p><p>In Kianda there are effectively 2 types of anonymous forms</p><ul><li>New process anonymous form</li><li>Existing process anonymous form</li></ul><h3 id=new-instance-anonymous-form-url>New instance anonymous form URL</h3><p>To set up a globally available link for allowing external users to create a new instance, perform the following steps within the form designer:</p><ol><li>On the top right corner of the designer click on the settings button.</li><li>Then click the option &ldquo;Enable anonymous sharing of forms&rdquo; to Yes.</li><li>Click the button &ldquo;New Link&rdquo; to generate a new anonymous link.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/anonymous-Forms.png alt="Anonymous Form Settings"></p><h3 id=existing-instance-anonymous-form-url>Existing instance anonymous form URL</h3><p>To setup existing instance anonymous form one needs to use the anonymous form rule to generate a new anonymous link at the runtime that will point to an existing process record that can then be shared with external users.</p><p>Note that for this to work steps 1 and 2 of New Instance Anonymous form is still required.</p><p>The following are some of the key options of the anonymous link rule:</p><ul><li>Form to share (any form within an existing process).</li><li>Link expires settings: Number of uses, time-based or never expire.</li><li>Message to display on submission.</li></ul><p><strong>Important</strong>: There can be only one active link of each type for a given process. Once a new anonymous link is created for a process it will automatically expire the previous of the same type if a link existed.</p><h2 id=input-fields>Input fields</h2><p>Kianda forms usability is brought to life with the help of the vario</p><h2 id=responsive-form-layout>Responsive form layout</h2><p>Form fields are made with a mobile-first approach giving you a &lsquo;design once and deploy everywhere&rsquo; opportunity.</p><p>By using the <strong>Layout</strong> option under the property panel you will be able to simply define the layout of your fields or panels within a form. Clicking on the <strong>^</strong> quickly uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.</p><p><img src=/images/layout-mode.png alt="Layout mode"></p><p>This allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows designing web interfaces with a mobile-first approach.</p><h2 id=forms--layout-fields>Forms & layout fields</h2><p>Kianda comes with several pre-defined field widgets. In case none of these satisfies your specific needs and if you have some level of <a href=development.md>development</a> skills you can always create your custom field widget.</p><p>At the time of writing, the default fields fall into four main categories of fields:</p><ol><li><strong>Input</strong> - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields.</li><li><strong>Layout</strong> - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields.</li><li><strong>Action</strong> - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components.</li><li><strong>Custom</strong> - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields available under your developer section.</li></ol><p>Layout fields take an important role when building a modern user interface and allow you to achieve the pixel perfect layout you want.</p><h3 id=model-dialogs>Model dialogs</h3><p>Model dialogs are a special form of layout fields. It allows a form designer to define an interface with the key intention of grabbing users attention to something important.</p><p>Typically we use dialogs for things like requiring user confirmation or to let them make a final decision.</p><p><em><strong>How to use a model dialog</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src="/videos/How to use a model dialog.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><p>On the example above, we use a modal dialog to display a simple <em>warning to the user</em>. The following are the steps:</p><ol><li>On the Layout components, select the <em>Dialog</em>.</li><li>Click on the dialog component to insert other fields within it.</li><li>You can add any field to your dialog, in this case, we are adding a Rich text.</li><li>To preview how your dialog box will be displayed, you can use the <strong>Preview</strong> button, on the dialog component.</li></ol><p>us input fields available that are specifically adapted to work in mobile, tablet or desktop modes.</p><p>From the textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table, Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be adjusted to work with a myriad of scenarios.</p><p>Key properties of fields:</p><p>Each field comes with its own set of settings like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input.</p><p>The following are some of the common settings of input fields:</p><ul><li>Title - Every field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user.</li><li>Required - This Boolean property allows making a field mandatory or not.</li><li>Visible - Displays the field in the form or not.</li><li>Layout - Defines both desktop or mobile layout.</li></ul><h3 id=cascading-dropdown>Cascading dropdown</h3><p>The List field provides the opportunity to define an unlimited level cascading dropdown hierarchy very easily.</p><p>To achieve that you might connect your list to a data source table or SharePoint list then use the list data source conditions options to filter its content based on a parent list.</p><p><img src=/images/cascading-dropdown.png alt="Cascading dropdown"></p><p><em><strong>How to create cascading dropdowns</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src="/videos/How to create cascading dropdowns.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=input-validation>Input validation</h2><p>Validating input in forms is quick and easy. Simply enable the <strong>required</strong> flag of an input field and it will automatically prevent users from submitting it empty.</p><p>The required flag will conveniently be ignored in case the field is not visible, this will allow you to configure conditionally mandatory fields.</p><p>Another way of validating input is to use the <strong>validate input rule</strong> this allows greater flexibility in terms of when or what to validate.</p><h2 id=cloning>Cloning</h2><p>In the form designer, almost any of the components can be cloned. This will increase your productivity considerably and will make creating multi-step processes a breeze.</p><p>To clone either a field, a panel or even a form, simply select the component then click the clone button in the properties panel in the right-hand side of the panel.</p><p>If cloning a field, the cloning dialog box will prompt for the destination of the new cloned field, once your choice is made, simply click ok.</p><p><em><strong>Cloning a form</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src="/videos/Cloning a form updated.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=custom-fields>Custom fields</h2><p>The Custom fields section provides access to fields that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. It is particularly useful in those situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.</p><p>Custom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. These custom fields can be built by developers. It allows a developer to build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes. Check-out the <a href=/docs/getting-started/welcome/low-code/>development</a> section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.</p><h2 id=advanced-techniques>Advanced techniques</h2><p>Like the cascading dropdown discussed above, several other advanced scenarios can be easily configured in Kianda. Here is a short-list:</p><ul><li><strong>Repeating section</strong> - A repeating section can be created by adding a <strong>panel</strong> to a table field. This table can be configured to include a single column made of the panel that itself will include the repeating fields of your repeating section.</li><li><strong>The capture of media</strong> - Kianda enables mobile users to directly capture pictures, video or audio just like a native application.</li><li><strong>Background save</strong> - By making use of PWA principles (Progressive Web Application), Kianda allows the ability to perform background operations. This is useful when, for example, a mobile user picks-up their phone to perform a quick action and places it back in his pocket.

By default, form designers can edit forms, but they can also set how other people interact with forms, for example to make forms viewable as <strong>read-only</strong>. Go to <a href=platform/form_management.md>Form management</a> to find out more about how form ownership works, and <a href=platform/form_interaction.md>Form interaction</a> to find out how a complete process flow works once forms are designed and assigned.

Forms contain all the buttons, fields, and rule triggers needed to execute your process.</p><p>There are three principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Reading modes</strong>: <strong>Form users</strong> can either use forms in <strong>edit</strong> mode or <strong>read</strong> mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review feedback in a form, but not be able to edit/update it. See <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/rules/><strong>Rules</strong></a> for more information on different types of rules.</p></li><li><p><strong>Form owner</strong>: The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to <strong>when the the form is created</strong>. By default, only this person or group <strong>can edit the form</strong>. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups.</p></li><li><p><strong>Current form</strong>: Typically there are several forms in a process, and by default, the <strong>first form</strong> in a process is the <strong>current form</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/3-form-example.jpg alt="Three form process example"></p><p>For example in the Training Attendance Process above, the process flow would be an employee fills out the <strong>Training Request</strong> > a manager approves the request in a <strong>Training Approval</strong> form > once approved a trainer completes a <strong>Training Attendance</strong> evaluation of the employee. When a process instance is initiated by an employee submitting a request, then the next form in the process becomes the <strong>current form</strong>, in this case the <strong>Training Approval</strong> form.</p><p>Only the form that has the status ‘<strong>current form’</strong> <strong>is editable</strong>. However, in a complex multi-step process, other forms can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form, meaning they can also become editable at the same time, creating a form group.</p></li></ol><p>These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below. These properties can also change <strong>dynamically</strong> as a result of <strong>rules being applied</strong>. See <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/rules/><strong>Rules</strong></a> for more information on different types of rules.</p><p><em><strong>New form dialog box</strong></em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/newformsegments-1.gif alt=img></p><h5 id=new-form-considerations>New form considerations</h5><ol><li>The <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field is where you can set individuals and groups as the default <strong>form owners</strong> who can edit the form.</li><li><strong>Activate with</strong> means that the form can be activated with other forms within the process, so they can be edited at the same time. This means several forms become the <strong>current form</strong> in a form group.</li><li><strong>Submit mode</strong> means that when a process instance is running you can choose <strong>only this form</strong> to be submitted, or you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong> meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved.</li><li><strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable a) reassignment, b) edit, and c) custom actions on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</li></ol><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced the principles of working with forms.

For example if an employee submits a performance review form, a line manager may wish to access that submitted process instance/record and edit the form, adding in comments and performance grades.</p><p>There are two key principles to keep in mind in terms of <strong>form access</strong>:</p><ol><li><p>Forms are <strong>assignable</strong> - this means that only a form assignee, that is, someone that is assigned to a form, can <strong>edit</strong> a particular form in a process instance. The &lsquo;assignee&rsquo; can be a combination of users and groups. There are various ways a form can be assigned to a user</p><p>​ a) Using <strong>Rules</strong>, in particular the Workflow rule Assign form, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> for details</p><p>​ b) Using <strong>Quick actions</strong>, see <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/>Form Quick action</a> for details</p><p>​ c) Creating <strong>form owners</strong> when creating or updating a process design, see <a href=#creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</a> for details</p></li><li><p><strong>Only form owners</strong> can edit a given form by <strong>default</strong>. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</p></li></ol><p>So what is <strong>form owner</strong>? A form owner is assigned when a form is created in Kianda Designer or form owners can be added to a process design at a later stage. Only the form owner will be able to edit <strong>process instances</strong> (records).</p><p>Once a process has been designed and users can initiate new process instances or records from a dashboard page, then the only people who can edit process records are the form owners or someone who has had the record assigned to them. For example, a line manager who is a form owner may need to add additional information about work goals in an appraisal form that their employee has already filled out.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-form-owners>Getting started with Form owners</h2><h3 id=creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</h3><ol><li>Click on a process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on an existing process or create a new process by clicking on <strong>Add new</strong> and complete the <strong>Add new process</strong> dialog box.</li><li>Then within Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> click on a form of interest and then click on the <strong>Edit/(Pen)</strong> <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit/Pen button"> button for that form.</li><li>In the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box you can add form owners in the <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/new-form-owners.jpg alt="Partner account details attributes"></p><p>​ Using the dropdown list choose from:</p><ul><li><strong>Users</strong> - Users must already be in the system, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/users/>Users & Groups</a></li><li><strong>Groups</strong> - Groups must be defined in advance, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/users/>Users & Groups</a></li><li><strong>Partners</strong> - Partners must be already in the system and active, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/b2b-portals/>B2B portals</a></li></ul><ol start=4><li>If you make a mistake, or form owners need to be changed in an existing process, click on the <strong>x</strong> beside the name of the <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> or <strong>Partners</strong> to remove them and choose from the dropdown list again.</li><li>Add to or edit the remaining parameters in the dialog box as desired, see <a href=#editing-forms/docs/platform/application-designer/designer/>Editing forms</a> and click on <strong>OK</strong> when complete, or <strong>Close</strong> to exit the dialog box at any time.</li></ol><h3 id=form-ownership-and-process-instances>Form ownership and process instances</h3><p>The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to <strong>when the the form is created</strong>. By default, only this person or group <strong>can edit the form</strong>. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-f2ca3086a88c04d95af05e5755cb758d>2.2 - Form display modes</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Remember there are three principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ul><li><strong>Reading modes</strong>: <strong>Form users</strong> can either use forms in <strong>edit</strong> mode or <strong>read</strong> mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review feedback in a form, but not be able to edit/update it.</li><li><strong>Form owner</strong>: The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to <strong>when the the form is created</strong>. By default, only this person or group <strong>can edit the form</strong>. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups.</li><li><strong>Current form</strong>: Typically there are several forms in a process, and only the form that has the status ‘<strong>current form’</strong> is <strong>editable</strong>. However, in a complex multi-step process, other forms can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form, meaning they can also become editable at the same time, creating a form group.</li></ul><p>These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below.</p><p><em><strong>New form dialog box</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/newformsegments-1.gif alt="New form dialog box"></p><p>These properties can also change <strong>dynamically</strong> as a result of <strong>rules being applied</strong>, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/>Rules</a>.</p><h3 id=how-to-set-edit-modes>How to set edit modes</h3><p>Remember forms in process instances are either in <strong>edit mode</strong> as in they can be edited/changed or <strong>read mode</strong> where the details are visible but cannot be changed. The actions below refer to making forms <strong>editable</strong> so if the actions below are not used, then the forms are in <strong>read mode</strong>.</p><ol><li>Forms in process instances will be <strong>editable</strong> for <strong>Default owner(s)</strong>, that is the <strong>form owners</strong> defined when the form is created, or a form is edited. Form owners are defined in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, shown in part 1 of the image above. When a process instance runs, the form owner can then edit the form in that instance.</li><li>By default the first form in a process becomes the <strong>current form</strong>, so only this form will be <strong>editable</strong> for form owners. However if several forms are <strong>activated with</strong> the current form, defined when the form is created or edited in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, then <strong>all forms in that group</strong> will be editable by the form owner in a process instance, as shown in part 2 of the image above.</li><li>By default the <strong>Submit mode</strong> is <strong>only this form</strong> meaning that when a process instance is running you can choose only that particular form can have details submitted. Alternatively you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong> meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved. For example if several forms are activated together and all are in <strong>edit mode</strong> then the details of all these forms can be submitted together.</li><li>Forms can be statically set to allow <strong>Quick actions</strong> including allowing <strong>editing</strong>. When a form is created or edited using the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, clicking on <strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable a) <strong>reassignment</strong>, b) <strong>edit</strong>, and c) <strong>custom actions</strong> on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means the user(s) assigns the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</li></ol><h3 id=changing-form-display-with-rules>Changing form display with rules</h3><p>If you use the <strong>Form action</strong> rule called <strong>Field display mode</strong> you can change how a field or form displays dynamically.</p><p>When you add this rule, under <strong>Action</strong> you can choose a field or form and choose from <strong>Edit mode</strong> or <strong>Read mode</strong>.

Fields are used to take in user input, make calculations, display values and so on, and rules are used to execute actions to drive the process.</p><p><strong>Kianda Designer</strong> is used to create these forms and form elements within a process. Each process in Kianda Designer will have it’s own unique link or URL and this can be shared with other form designers for co-creation, for example, for a process named ‘Training process’ the link is:</p><p><a href=https://green-itr.kianda.com/admin/designer/training-process>https://green-itr.kianda.com/admin/designer/training-process</a></p><h2 id=process-instances>Process instances</h2><p>When your process is created in Kianda Designer, you can save the process, and then <strong>submit data</strong> to that process. When you save or submit data, then an <strong>instance</strong> of the process is created. Another name for a process instance is a <strong>record</strong>. This instance is tied to user data or calculated values, or to whatever the process is designed to do.</p><p>The instance has a unique ID which can be seen in a list widget in a <strong>dashboard</strong>. For example, this List widget displays the individual records of various training requests submitted by employees. The unique ID for each record is shown in the first column. Form owners or those with security access can click on ID ‘training-request-and-feedback-process-26’ to view the training request form completed and submitted by employee Mark Donnelli.</p><p><em><strong>List widget in a dashboard showing process instances</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/process-instance.jpg alt="Process instance example"></p><p>This means that each new record generated by a process will have its own unique URL that can be shared with those who have the required security access and need to be involved in that <strong>particular process instance</strong>. For example, in this case, the training request submitted by Mark (an employee) may be viewed and approved by his line manager:</p><p><a href=https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/training-request-and-feedback-process-26>https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/training-request-and-feedback-process-26</a></p><p>You can create a link on your dashboard – in the example shown above, the <strong>Start new process</strong> button at the top right of the Training Requests list widget – that enables you to create a <strong>new record</strong> by bringing you into the relevant form.
