In case none of these satisfies your specific needs and if you have some level of <a href=development.md>development</a> skills you can always create your custom field widget.</p><p>At the time of writing, the default fields fall into four main categories of fields:</p><ol><li><strong>Input</strong> - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields.</li><li><strong>Layout</strong> - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields.</li><li><strong>Action</strong> - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components.</li><li><strong>Custom</strong> - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields available under your developer section.</li></ol><p>Layout fields take an important role when building a modern user interface and allow you to achieve the pixel perfect layout you want.</p><h3 id=model-dialogs>Model dialogs</h3><p>Model dialogs are a special form of layout fields. It allows a form designer to define an interface with the key intention of grabbing users attention to something important.</p><p>Typically we use dialogs for things like requiring user confirmation or to let them make a final decision.</p><p><em><strong>How to use a model dialog</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src="/videos/How to use a model dialog.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><p>On the example above, we use a modal dialog to display a simple <em>warning to the user</em>. The following are the steps:</p><ol><li>On the Layout components, select the <em>Dialog</em>.</li><li>Click on the dialog component to insert other fields within it.</li><li>You can add any field to your dialog, in this case, we are adding a Rich text.</li><li>To preview how your dialog box will be displayed, you can use the <strong>Preview</strong> button, on the dialog component.</li></ol><h3 id=forms>Forms</h3><p>Forms are an important component of any process, they might be used as stages of a process and could be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).</p><p>The key rules for working with forms are:</p><ol><li>Forms are assignable - means that only a form assignee can edit a particular form. This can be a combination of users and groups.</li><li>Only form owners can edit a given form by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</li><li>Multi-step processes use the concept of &ldquo;current form&rdquo;. Only the form matching the process status will be made editable.</li><li>In a multi-step process, other forms that are not &ldquo;current form&rdquo; can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form. Meaning they might also be editable and will form a form group.</li></ol><p>The rules above work together to determine if the form is in edit mode or display mode. Form designers have at their disposal <a href=business-rules.md>business rules</a> such as <em>assign form</em>, <em>go to form</em> and <em>submit rule</em> to dynamically control the ability for end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.</p><p><em><strong>How to add new form</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src="/videos/How to add new form 2.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><ol><li>Click on <em>Add form</em>, on the top right side of the page.</li><li>Give your form a title.</li><li>The <em>name</em> is a unique identifier - you can leave it as it is.</li><li>You can define an owner to the form.</li><li>Activate with will decide when the form will be active - if you leave it blank, the new form will be activated <em>sequentially</em> after the first form is submitted.</li><li>Select <em>Submit mode</em> - you can submit just the current form or all forms that are in edit mode.</li><li>Check <em>Enable quick actions</em> if you want the form to be edited or re-assigned.</li><li>Provide a user or group in the <em>Quick action user (s)</em> to whom you would like to permit to re-assign or edit the form.</li></ol><h2 id=anonymous-forms>Anonymous Forms</h2><p>Anonymous forms are a great way of allowing people outside of your organisation to interact with your processes.</p><p>It could be something as simple as a contact form or a feedback form but as we all know a contact form never ends with the contact submission. There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result back to the person that started the submission.</p><p>We have seen a few examples of how people use anonymous forms in Kianda. From simple feedback forms to GDPR data requests that hope between multi divisions before sending back a response to the requester with the level of information held by the organization.</p><p>Anonymous forms can be embedded in iframes and safely displayed within other web-based applications.</p><p>In Kianda there are effectively 2 types of anonymous forms</p><ul><li>New process anonymous form</li><li>Existing process anonymous form</li></ul><h3 id=new-instance-anonymous-form-url>New instance anonymous form URL</h3><p>To set up a globally available link for allowing external users to create a new instance, perform the following steps within the form designer:</p><ol><li>On the top right corner of the designer click on the settings button.</li><li>Then click the option &ldquo;Enable anonymous sharing of forms&rdquo; to Yes.</li><li>Click the button &ldquo;New Link&rdquo; to generate a new anonymous link.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/anonymous-forms.png alt="Anonymous Form Settings"></p><h3 id=existing-instance-anonymous-form-url>Existing instance anonymous form URL</h3><p>To setup existing instance anonymous form one needs to use the anonymous form rule to generate a new anonymous link at the runtime that will point to an existing process record that can then be shared with external users.</p><p>Note that for this to work steps 1 and 2 of New Instance Anonymous form is still required.</p><p>The following are some of the key options of the anonymous link rule:</p><ul><li>Form to share (any form within an existing process).</li><li>Link expires settings: Number of uses, time-based or never expire.</li><li>Message to display on submission.</li></ul><p><strong>Important</strong>: There can be only one active link of each type for a given process. Once a new anonymous link is created for a process it will automatically expire the previous of the same type if a link existed.</p><h2 id=input-fields>Input fields</h2><p>Kianda forms usability is brought to life with the help of the various input fields available that are specifically adapted to work in mobile, tablet or desktop modes.</p><p>From the textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table, Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be adjusted to work with a myriad of scenarios.</p><p>Key properties of fields:</p><p>Each field comes with its own set of settings like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input.</p><p>The following are some of the common settings of input fields:</p><ul><li>Title - Every field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user.</li><li>Required - This Boolean property allows making a field mandatory or not.</li><li>Visible - Displays the field in the form or not.</li><li>Layout - Defines both desktop or mobile layout.</li></ul><h3 id=cascading-dropdown>Cascading dropdown</h3><p>The List field provides the opportunity to define an unlimited level cascading dropdown hierarchy very easily.</p><p>To achieve that you might connect your list to a data source table or SharePoint list then use the list data source conditions options to filter its content based on a parent list.</p><p><img src=/images/cascading-dropdown.png alt="Cascading dropdown"></p><p><em><strong>How to create cascading dropdowns</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src="/videos/How to create cascading dropdowns.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=input-validation>Input validation</h2><p>Validating input in forms is quick and easy. Simply enable the <strong>required</strong> flag of an input field and it will automatically prevent users from submitting it empty.</p><p>The required flag will conveniently be ignored in case the field is not visible, this will allow you to configure conditionally mandatory fields.</p><p>Another way of validating input is to use the <strong>validate input rule</strong> this allows greater flexibility in terms of when or what to validate.</p><h2 id=cloning>Cloning</h2><p>In the form designer, almost any of the components can be cloned. This will increase your productivity considerably and will make creating multi-step processes a breeze.</p><p>To clone either a field a panel or even a form simple select the component then click the clone button in the properties panel in the right-hand side of the panel.</p><p>If cloning a field the cloning dialog will prompt for the destination of the new cloned field, once your choice is made, simply click ok.</p><p><em><strong>Cloning a form</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src="/videos/Cloning a form updated.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=custom-fields>Custom fields</h2><p>Custom fields section provides access to fields that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. It is particularly useful in those situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.</p><p>Custom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. If you need to build &ldquo;an action&rdquo; then you should use a custom rule widget.</p><p>It allows a developer to build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes.</p><p>Check-out the <a href=development.md>development</a> section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.</p><h2 id=advanced-techniques>Advanced techniques</h2><p>Like the cascading dropdown discussed above, several other advanced scenarios can be easily configured in Kianda. Here is a short-list:</p><ul><li><strong>Repeating section</strong> - A repeating section can be created by adding a <strong>panel</strong> to a table field. This table can be configured to include a single column made of the panel that itself will include the repeating fields of your repeating section.</li><li><strong>The capture of media</strong> - Kianda enables mobile users to directly capture pictures, video or audio just like a native application.</li><li><strong>Background save</strong> - By making use of PWA principles (Progressive Web Application) Kianda allows the ability to perform background operations. This is useful when, for example, a mobile user picks-up their phone to perform a quick action and places it back in his pocket. Operations will continue in the background allowing all data to be captured.</li><li><strong>Image annotation</strong> - Kianda allows for image annotation online or offline.</li><li><strong>Multi-column / row layout</strong> - Making multi-column responsive interfaces is quite easy. Simply add two panels into a form that only use half of the screen (6 columns) then add fields inside panels and you have multiple column layouts. Adding a panel using 12 columns gives you a row.</li><li><strong>Form tab colour and icon</strong> - Form tabs can be quickly customised to display their icons or tab colours, it is also possible to define custom colours for selected and completed form tabs.</li><li><strong>Hide form tab and left nav</strong> - This is self-explanatory, yes you can hide the default navigation elements.</li></ul></div></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-2f4258c04d1e2f0a31f1e90e21271791>1 - Designer</h1><p>Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> provides an intuitive interface where you can quickly start building <strong>forms</strong> for any business use case.

<source src=/videos/designerintro.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><p>There are 3 key principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ol><li>Form <strong>design</strong> - what a form looks like, what elements it contains, for example controls and rules</li><li>Form <strong>interaction</strong> - how users can use forms depending on certain sequences happening</li><li>Form <strong>management</strong> - who can edit and access forms</li></ol><p>This page presents the information you need related to form design, that is what a form looks like, and what it contains. By default, form designers can edit forms, but they can also set how other people interact with forms, for example to make forms viewable as <strong>read-only</strong>. Go to <a href=platform/form_management.md>Form management</a> to find out more about how form ownership works, and <a href=platform/form_interaction.md>Form interaction</a> to find out how a complete process flow works once forms are designed and assigned. Read the steps below to find out more about Form design.</p><h2 id=designer-layout>Designer layout</h2><p>To access processes, go to the left-hand pane and <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process that you have created or imported, see <a href=platform/process.md>Getting started with Kianda processes</a>.</p><p>From the main process view, click on any process to add forms.

Forms contain all the buttons, fields, and rule triggers needed to execute your process.</p><p>There are three principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ul><li><strong>Reading modes</strong>: <strong>Form users</strong> can either use forms in <strong>edit</strong> mode or <strong>read</strong> mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review feedback in a form, but not be able to edit/update it. See <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/rules/><strong>Rules</strong></a> for more information on different types of rules.</li><li><strong>Form owner</strong>: The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to <strong>when the the form is created</strong>. By default, only this person or group <strong>can edit the form</strong>. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups.</li><li><strong>Current form</strong>: Typically there are several forms in a process, and only the form that has the status ‘<strong>current form’</strong> is editable. However, in a complex multi-step process, other forms can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form, meaning they can also become editable at the same time, creating a form group.</li></ul><p>These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below. These properties can also change <strong>dynamically</strong> as a result of <strong>rules being applied</strong>. See <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/rules/><strong>Rules</strong></a> for more information on different types of rules.</p><p><em><strong>New form dialog box</strong></em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/newformsegments-1.gif alt=img></p><h5 id=new-form-considerations>New form considerations</h5><ol><li>The <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field is where you can set individuals and groups as the default <strong>form owners</strong> who can edit the form.</li><li><strong>Activate with</strong> means that the form can be activated with other forms within the process, so they can be edited at the same time. This means several forms become the <strong>current form</strong> in a form group.</li><li><strong>Submit mode</strong> means that when a process instance is running you can choose <strong>only this form</strong> to be submitted, or you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong> meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved.</li><li><strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable a) reassignment, b) edit, and c) custom actions on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means the user(s) assigns the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</li></ol></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-f2ca3086a88c04d95af05e5755cb758d>2.1 - Form display modes</h1></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-ef48b6171c7c6a9791bf53a2c8638848>2.2 - Form owners</h1></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-91e87a061202a15b4442671707316f31>2.3 - Form quick actions menu</h1><p>The Quick action menu contains all the shortcuts that you need to manage your pages efficiently.

And you can customise all of these processes the way you want.</p><p>Before you begin, we at Kianda recommend doing some simple planning before you design your process. It could be something as simple as a quick flow chart or a spreadsheet where you quickly log the key components, fields or rules that should be needed in the process.</p><h2 id=creating-processes>Creating processes</h2><ol><li><p>To start creating your first process, go to the side menu on the left of the screen and click on <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong>.</p></li><li><p>To create processes you can:</p><ul><li><p>Use Kianda&rsquo;s pre-defined processes or Apps, see <a href=#using-the-app-store>Using the App Store</a>.</p></li><li><p>Create your own processes from scratch, see <a href=#creating-your-own-processes>Creating your own processes</a>.</p></li><li><p>Import processes that are already created, see <a href=#importing-processes>Importing processes</a>.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>When you have created your process(es) go to <a href=#editing-processes>Editing processes</a> to find out how to start adding forms.</p></li><li><p>You can also export any processes for backup and reuse, see <a href=#exporting-processes>Exporting processes</a>.</p></li></ol><h3 id=using-the-app-store>Using the App Store</h3><ol><li><p>You can choose from Kianda&rsquo;s process templates by clicking on the <strong>App Store</strong> button <img src=images/appstore.png alt="App Store button">.</p></li><li><p>Choose from <strong>General</strong>, <strong>IT</strong>, <strong>Customer Services</strong>, <strong>Finance</strong>, <strong>Travel</strong>, <strong>Quality</strong> and <strong>Accounting</strong> apps by clicking on the relevant button in the left-hand pane and then select an app from within that category, for example Customer Support Queries.</p><p>Click on <a href=platform/appstore.md>Kianda Apps</a> to find out more about other apps in the App Store.</p><p><img src=images/appstoreegs.png alt="App Store General Apps"></p></li><li><p>You can click on <strong>Read More</strong> to read about the app and click on <strong>Import Process App</strong> to import the process.</p><p><img src=images/supportapp.png alt="Customer Support Queries App"></p></li><li><p>If the process is an existing process, you can choose to override the existing process by clicking <strong>Yes</strong> or if not, click <strong>No</strong>.
