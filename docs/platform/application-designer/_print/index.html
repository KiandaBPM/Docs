Users with the role <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong> can create <strong>forms</strong> that can connect to any number of <strong>data sources</strong> at the same time. The form might be a simple contact form or something else more complex, and you can add more forms like &ldquo;Follow-up form&rdquo; or even a &ldquo;Closure form&rdquo;. To the form you can add predefined <strong>controls</strong> or fields, and <strong>business rules</strong> to define how the processes can behave.</p><img src=/images/process-elements.jpg alt=process-forms-controls-rules style=zoom:70%><p>These process elements, <strong>processes</strong>, <strong>forms</strong>, <strong>controls</strong> and <strong>rules</strong> are explained in the sections below:</p><ul><li><a href=#creating-your-first-process>Creating your first process</a></li><li><a href=forms>Forms</a></li><li><a href=#form-fields>Controls or form fields</a></li><li><a href=#rules>Rules</a></li></ul><p>Forms, fields and rules are created and edited using Kianda <a href=#kianda-designer-introduction>Designer</a> explained in further on this page.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><p>Although Kianda aims to be intuitive and easy to get started, it is never difficult to over-engineer. So at Kianda we always recommend doing some simple planning before you design your first form. It could be something as simple as a quick flow chart or a spreadsheet where you can quickly log the key components, fields or rules that are needed in the process.</p><p>In general there are three key steps to build a process in an agile manner:</p><ol><li><strong>Plan</strong> process design, forms, fields, rules, log into design spreadsheet.</li><li><strong>Build</strong> forms and fields connecting to data where applicable.</li><li><strong>Publish</strong> to dashboards, launch anonymous forms or publish to data sources for end-user distribution.</li></ol><p><em><strong>Platform getting started video</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

They might be used as stages of a process and could be made active individually or at the same time known as <strong>parallel</strong> forms.</p><p>The key rules related to designing forms for user interaction are:</p><ol><li>Forms are <strong>assignable</strong>, this means that <strong>only a form assignee can edit</strong> a particular form in a process instance. The form assignee can be a combination of users and groups.</li><li>When a form is created, as a designer you can configure form owners. <strong>Only form owners can edit</strong> a given form in a process instance by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</li><li>Processes that have several steps use the concept of <strong>current form</strong>, where only the current form is <strong>editable</strong> in a process instance. Forms become the current form as the process executes sequentially. Rules like <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/go-to-form/>Go to form</a> can be used to make forms the current form. Other forms can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form. This means it is also possible to edit these forms at the same point in process execution and togther the forms form a form group.</li></ol><p>The rules above work together to determine if the form is in edit mode or display mode. Form designers have at their disposal <a href=/docs/platform/rules/>business rules</a> such as <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a>, <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/go-to-form/>Go to form</a> and <a href=/docs/platform/rules/form-actions/submit-form/>Submit form</a> to dynamically control the ability for end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.</p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

Fields include textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table, to name a few. Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be adjusted to work with a myriad of scenarios.</p><p><em><strong>Example of a form in a process with a text box field</strong></em>
<img src=/images/textbox-example.jpg alt="Textbox example"></p><p>Each field comes with its own set of:</p><p>a) <strong>settings</strong> like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input</p><p>b) <strong>properties</strong> that determine how the field will display.</p><p>The following are some of the common <strong>properties</strong> of input fields. Field properties <strong>appear when the field is selected</strong> within a form, as shown in the image above for the text box field. The properties appear on the right:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Title</strong> - every field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user</p></li><li><p><strong>Show title</strong> - check this property to show the title of a field in a form</p></li><li><p><strong>Required</strong> - this Boolean property allows a form designer to make a field mandatory or not</p></li><li><p><strong>Enabled</strong> - check this property to make the field appear in a form for a user to use</p></li><li><p><strong>Visible</strong> - displays the field in the form or not depending on checking the checkbox</p></li><li><p><strong>Layout</strong> - defines both desktop or mobile layout by selecting a size from the blue bar presented, see <a href=#responsive-form-layout>Responsive form layout</a> for more details.</p></li></ul><p>In addition to the field properties, each field has it&rsquo;s own settings that you can change simply by selecting the field and clicking on the <strong>Edit/Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit/pen button">. This will open an <strong>Edit field</strong> dialog box where you can change settings.</p><p>In total there are 16 predefined field widgets, see <a href=#categories-of-fields>Categories of fields</a> below. In case none of these satisfies your specific needs and if you have some level of <a href=/docs/platform/administration/developer/>development</a> skills you can always create your custom field widget.</p><h2 id=categories-of-fields>Categories of fields</h2><p>Currently the default fields fall into four main categories of fields:</p><ol><li><strong>Input</strong> - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields.</li><li><strong>Layout</strong> - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields.</li><li><strong>Action</strong> - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components.</li><li><strong>Custom</strong> - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields available under your developer section.</li></ol><p>The following headings showcase examples of fields and how they can be used to play an important role when building a modern user interface while allowing you to achieve the pixel perfect layout you want. The examples shown are <a href=#modal-dialogs>Modal dialogs</a> and <a href=#cascading-dropdown-lists>Cascading dropdown lists</a> in the following sections.</p><h3 id=model-dialogs>Model dialogs</h3><p>Model dialogs are a special form of <strong>layout</strong> fields. It allows a form designer to define an interface with the key intention of grabbing users&rsquo; attention to something important.</p><p>Typically dialogs are used to create alerts, for example a user confirmation or to help users make a final decision in a process.</p><p><em><strong>How to use a model dialog</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src="/videos/How to use a model dialog.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><p>In the example above, we use a modal dialog to display a simple <strong>warning to the user</strong>. The following are the steps involved to create this:</p><ol><li><p>Choose a process, or create a new process, and select a form in that process to add fields to. In the left-hand pane of Kianda Designer, click on <strong>Controls</strong> > <strong>Layout</strong> > <strong>Dialog</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Click on the <strong>dialog component</strong> to edit the dialog, for example give the dialog a <strong>Title</strong> and then <strong>insert</strong> other fields within it. You can add any field to your dialog, for example add Richtext by clicking on <strong>Controls</strong> > <strong>Layout</strong> > <strong>Richtext</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Give your Richtext field a <strong>title</strong>, and add a <strong>message</strong> in the Richtext body text and change other settings as needed. Click on <strong>OK</strong> when complete or click on <strong>Close</strong> at any time to exit the dialog box.</p></li><li><p>To preview how your dialog box will be displayed, you can use the <strong>Preview</strong> button, on the dialog component.</p><p><img src=/images/preview-dialog.jpg alt="Preview dialog"></p></li></ol><h3 id=cascading-dropdown-lists>Cascading dropdown lists</h3><p>Using the <strong>List field</strong> provides the opportunity to define an unlimited level cascading dropdown hierarchy very easily. For example in the form below, if a user chooses Denmark as a country from the drop-down list, then Danish cities are displayed, while if another country is chosen, the other cities for that country are displayed.</p><p><img src=/images/dropdown-cascading-lists.jpg alt="Dropdown cascading lists"></p><p>To achieve this effect, you can connect your list to a data source, for example a SharePoint list or table. Then use the list data source <a href=/docs/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>conditions</a> options to filter content based on a parent list.</p><p><img src=/images/cascading-list-conditions.jpg alt="Cascading dropdown"></p><p>In the example above, the condition used is that a filter is applied if data from the <strong>SharePoint list column</strong> called <strong>Country</strong> is chosen as input for the <strong>form list field</strong> called <strong>Country</strong>, then data from the SharePoint list column called Cities is displayed, see video below.</p><p><em><strong>How to create cascading dropdowns</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src="/videos/How to create cascading dropdowns.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><h2 id=easy-to-customise-form-features>Easy to customise form features</h2><p>Remember with Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> you don&rsquo;t need any coding experience, so anyone with <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong> access can use Kianda&rsquo;s easy to use interface to add fields to forms and customise forms to create the desired effects for an optimum user experience. The Kianda interface makes it easy to create sophisticated forms that follow modern web design principles, all at the click of a button. Examples of ways to customise forms are shown in the following sections, <a href=#responsive-form-layout>Responsive form layout</a> and <a href=#input-validation>Input validation</a>.</p><h3 id=responsive-form-layout>Responsive form layout</h3><p>When designing forms, its easy to change the layout of fields to make the field display the way you want. Form fields are made with a mobile-first approach giving you a &lsquo;design once and deploy everywhere&rsquo; opportunity.</p><p>When you select a field, you can go to <strong>Field properties</strong> in the right-hand pane of Kianda Designer and click on the <strong>Layout</strong> option.</p><p>Clicking on <strong>Collapse or expand responsive layout</strong> button <img src=/images/collapse-responsive-button.jpg alt="Collapse responsive layout button"> uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.</p><p><img src=/images/layout-mode.png alt="Layout mode"></p><p>Click on the blue bar for both <strong>Layout</strong> and <strong>Mobile Layout</strong> to adjust the size of the field. This allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows designing web interfaces with a mobile-first approach.</p><h3 id=input-validation>Input validation</h3><p>As with editing the layout of fields, it is easy to validate input, making fields mandatory for users to fill in or not. Go to <strong>Field properties</strong> in the right-hand pane of Kianda Designer and click on the <strong>Required</strong> option. If already ticked, uncheck this to make the field not required.</p><p><img src=/images/field-properties-example.jpg alt="Field properties for the field &amp;lsquo;City&amp;rsquo;"></p><p>Simply enable the checking the <strong>Required</strong> property in this way will automatically prevent users from submitting forms with an empty field. The required flag will conveniently be ignored in case the field is not visible, this will allow you to configure conditionally mandatory fields.</p><p>Another way of validating input is to use the <strong>validate input rule</strong> which allows for greater flexibility in terms of when or what to validate. <a href=#rules>Rules</a> are explained below, but click on <a href=/docs/platform/rules/form-actions/validate-input/>Validate input</a> for more information specifically on this rule.</p><p>In addition to changing field properties, you can configure <a href=#settings>settings</a> to make processes perform the way you want.</p><h2 id=settings>Settings</h2><p>In addition to <strong>changing field properties</strong> like <a href=#input-validation>Input validation</a>, you can <strong>edit process, form and field</strong> <strong>settings</strong>. Having settings at each level will allow you to tweak your process design in minutes.</p><p>At the highest level, <strong>process settings</strong> are found in the right-hand side pane of Kianda <strong>Designer</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/process-settings.jpg alt="Process settings"></p><p>There are many options within <strong>Settings</strong> to manage for example process security and set process instance settings. One setting example is <strong>Enabling anonymous sharing of forms</strong> explained in more detail below.</p><p><img src=/images/process-settings-anonymous.jpg alt="Process settings"></p><h3 id=anonymous-forms>Anonymous forms</h3><p><strong>Anonymous forms</strong> are a great way of <strong>allowing people outside of your organisation</strong> to interact with your processes. It could be something as simple as a feedback form or a GDPR data request but as we all know a contact form never ends with the contact submission. There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result back to the person that started the submission, or person assigned to manage the form.</p><p>Anonymous forms can be embedded using iframes or inline frames. Inline frames are HTML elements that allow another HTML page(s) to be loaded within the document, basically allowing one webpage within another. In Kianda there are effectively two types of anonymous forms:</p><ul><li><a href=#new-process-instance-anonymous-form-url>New process instance anonymous form URL</a></li><li><a href=#existing-instance-anonymous-form-url>Existing process anonymous form URL</a></li></ul><h4 id=new-process-instance-anonymous-form-url>New process instance anonymous form URL</h4><p>To set up a <strong>globally available link</strong> to allow external users to create a new process instance, perform the following steps within Kianda designer:</p><ol><li>Within a chosen process, in the top right click on <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Then beside <strong>Enable anonymous sharing of forms</strong> select <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>Click the button <strong>New Link</strong> to generate a new anonymous link.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/enable-anonymous-sharing.jpg alt="Anonymous Form Settings"></p><p>The generated link can be shared to allow sharing of the form to users without the need for a Kianda account.</p><h4 id=existing-instance-anonymous-form-url>Existing instance anonymous form URL</h4><p>To setup an <strong>existing instance</strong> <strong>anonymous form</strong> you need to use the <strong>Anonymous form link rule</strong> to generate a new anonymous link at runtime that will point to an existing process record that can then be shared with external users.</p><p>Note that for this to work steps 1 and 2 of <a href=#new-process-instance-anonymous-form-url>New Instance Anonymous form</a> are still required.</p><p>The following are some of the key options of the anonymous link rule:</p><ul><li>Choose a Form to share (any form within an existing process).</li><li>Link expires settings: choose from an expiry parameter like number of uses, time-based or never expire.</li><li>Select a Message to display on submission.</li></ul><p><strong>Important</strong>: There can be only one active link of each type for a given process. Once a new anonymous link is created for a process it will automatically cause an expiry of a previous link of the same type.</p><h2 id=rules>Rules</h2><p>Kianda <strong>rules</strong> allow for dynamic actions within processes that can be used to change the workflow, send automated emails or notifications, as well as manipulate data in data sources.</p><p>There are 60 predefined rules, across 10 categories that allow you to drive your business processes in a myriad of ways. Go to the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/>Rules</a> section to navigate to each of the different field categories.</p><p>Rules can be driven by <a href=/docs/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/>conditions</a> for example based on user input, form fields will dynamically appear or hide according to how the user navigates a form, and all rules are <strong>actions</strong> which can involve for example retrieving values from a datasource, storing data in a field or automating user addition to Salesforce.</p><p>One example of rules already mentioned is the <strong>Anonymous form link</strong> rule which will dynamically generate and send a link from a form in a process to an external user, without the need for a Kianda account.</p><p>If the current suite of predefined rules do not meet your needs, you can use Kianda <strong>Developer</strong> to create your own rule widget. In a similar fashion you can use this function to create <a href=#custom-fields>custom controls or fields</a>, see more below.</p><h2 id=custom-fields>Custom fields</h2><p>In case any of the previously mentioned control types don&rsquo;t suit, you can use Kianda to build your own customised control widgets. The Custom fields section provides access to fields that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. It is particularly useful in those situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.</p><p>Custom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. These <strong>custom fields can be built by developers</strong>. It allows a developer to build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes. Check-out the <a href=/docs/getting-started/welcome/low-code/>development</a> section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.</p><h3 id=advanced-techniques>Advanced techniques</h3><p>Like the <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/#cascading-dropdown-lists>cascading drop-down list</a> discussed above, several other advanced scenarios can be easily configured in Kianda. Here is a short-list to give you an idea what is possible:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Repeating section</strong> - A repeating section can be created by adding a <strong>panel</strong> to a table field. This table can be configured to include a single column made of the panel that itself will include the repeating fields of your repeating section.</p></li><li><p><strong>The capture of media</strong> - Kianda enables mobile users to directly capture pictures, video or audio just like a native application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Background save</strong> - By making use of PWA principles (Progressive Web Application), Kianda allows the ability to perform background operations. This is useful when, for example, a mobile user picks-up their phone to perform a quick action and places it back in his pocket. Operations will continue in the background allowing all data to be captured.</p></li><li><p><strong>Image annotation</strong> - Kianda allows for image annotation online or offline.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multi-column / row layout</strong> - Making multi-column responsive interfaces is quite easy. Simply add two panels into a form that only use half of the screen (6 columns) then add fields inside panels and you have multiple column layouts. Adding a panel using 12 columns gives you a row.</p></li><li><p><strong>Form tab colour and icon</strong> - Form tabs can be quickly customised to display their icons or tab colours, it is also possible to define custom colours for selected and completed form tabs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hide form tab and left nav</strong> - This is self-explanatory, yes you can hide the default navigation elements.</p></li></ul><p>Once you have started creating elements in Kianda forms it is easy to replicate elements and make process design happen even faster, see <a href=#cloning>Cloning</a> below.</p><h2 id=cloning>Cloning</h2><p>In Kianda <strong>Designer</strong>, almost any of the components can be cloned. This will increase your productivity considerably and will make creating multi-step processes a breeze.</p><p>To clone either a field, a panel or even a form, simply select the component then click the clone button in the properties panel in the right-hand side of the panel.</p><p>If cloning a field, the cloning dialog box will prompt for the destination of the new cloned field, once your choice is made, simply click ok.</p><p><em><strong>Cloning a form</strong></em></p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>

Forms are an important component of any process. They might be used as a stage of a process and can be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).</p><h2 id=how-designer-works>How Designer works</h2><p>This video introduces Kianda Designer and demonstrates how to start creating a form and add fields.</p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
<source src=/videos/designerintro.mp4>Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><p>There are 3 key principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ol><li>Form <strong>design</strong> - what a form looks like, what elements it contains, for example controls and rules</li><li>Form <strong>interaction</strong> - how users can use forms depending on certain sequences happening</li><li>Form <strong>management</strong> - who can edit and access forms</li></ol><p>This page presents the information you need related to <strong>form design</strong>, that is what a form looks like, and what it contains. By default, <strong>Administrators</strong> and those with the <strong>Design business process</strong> role can edit forms, but they can also set how other people interact with forms, for example to make forms viewable as <strong>read-only</strong>. Go to <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-owners/>Form owners</a> to find out more about how form ownership works, and <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-display-modes/>Form display modes</a> to find out out more about how forms display.</p><h2 id=designer-layout>Designer layout</h2><p>To access processes, go to the left-hand pane and <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process that you have created or imported, see <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/#creating-your-first-process>Create your first process</a>.</p><p>From the main process view, click on any process to add forms.

Forms contain all the buttons, fields, and rule triggers needed to execute your process.</p><p>Using your <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong> role, you will use Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> to design <strong>forms</strong> for <strong>end users</strong> who will use the platform to submit, save and review information, either as named users in the platform, users who receive a link to an anonymous form, or partners who can access shared processes. These end users will create new <strong>process instances</strong> or records in the system, or access <strong>existing process instances</strong> which shows information that has either been <strong>saved or submitted</strong> in a form.</p><p>When discussing forms we&rsquo;ll talk about <strong>form design</strong> that is creating and updating forms within a process using Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> as well <strong>form use</strong> which refers to end users who will edit or read forms in a process instance/record in the system, built using the <strong>Designer</strong>.</p><h2 id=form-design-principles>Form design principles</h2><p>As you work with Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> you are designing the &lsquo;user interface&rsquo; for users to interact with a particular process. Keeping the end user in mind, there are three design principles:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Reading modes</strong>: <strong>Form users</strong> can either use/access forms in <strong>edit</strong> mode or <strong>read</strong> mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review customer feedback in a form, but not be able to change/edit the feedback form.</p></li><li><p><strong>Current form</strong>: Typically there are several forms in a process, and by default the <strong>first form</strong> in a process is the <strong>current form</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/3-form-example.jpg alt="Three form process example"></p><p>For example in the Training Attendance Process above, the process flow is as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Training Request</strong> - an employee initiates a process instance by filling out this form</p></li><li><p><strong>Training Approval</strong> - the manager approves the request using this form</p></li><li><p><strong>Training Attendance</strong> - when training approval occurs, a trainer invites the employee to attend training and once complete, the trainer completes a this form to evaluate the employee&rsquo;s participation.</p><p>Therefore when a process instance is initiated upon submission of the <strong>Training Request</strong> form, then the next form in the process becomes the <strong>current form</strong>, in this case the <strong>Training Approval</strong> form.</p><p>Only the form that has the status ‘<strong>current form’</strong> <strong>is editable</strong> by a form owner (see point 3 below). In a complex multi-step process, several forms can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form, meaning they are also editable at the same time, creating a <strong>form group</strong>, see section 2 of [New form creation](#new-f orm-creation). Rules can also be used to change the workflow and make other forms the &lsquo;current form&rsquo;.</p><p>Also note that <strong>all first forms</strong> in a process flow add the current user as a &lsquo;form owner&rsquo; therefore allowing <strong>all users</strong> to edit the first form, as clicking on &lsquo;submit&rsquo; or &lsquo;save&rsquo; in the first form results in a new process instance.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Form owner</strong>: The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to, this means they can <strong>edit the <u>current</u> form(s) in a process instance</strong>. Default owners are typically set when a form is created, see section 1 of <a href=#new-form-creation>New form creation</a> below. By default, <strong>only this person or group can edit the <u>current</u> form</strong> in a process instance. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups. Form ownership can also be assigned dynamically using the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> rule.</p></li></ol><p>These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below, and these parameters can be updated at any time by editing the form design. These properties can also change <strong>dynamically</strong> as a result of <strong>implementing rules</strong>, for example the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/go-to-form/>Go to form</a> rule can change the workflow in a process.</p><h3 id=new-form-creation>New form creation</h3><p>As mentioned in the <a href=#introduction>Introduction</a> there are certain considerations to keep in mind when working with forms. The image below shows a <strong>New form</strong> dialog box that is created when the <strong>Add form</strong> button is clicked in Kianda Designer. At any time if you click on a form and then the <strong>Edit/pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit/pen button"> an <strong>Edit form</strong> dialog box appears which has the same parameters as the one shown in the image below.</p><p><em><strong>New form dialog box</strong></em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/newformsegments-1.gif alt=img></p><h5 id=new-form-considerations>New form considerations</h5><ol><li>The <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field is where you can set individuals and groups as the default <strong>form owners</strong> who can edit the form.</li><li><strong>Activate with</strong> means that the form can be activated with other forms within the process, so they can be edited at the same time. This means several forms become the <strong>current form</strong> in a form group.</li><li><strong>Submit mode</strong> means that when a process instance is running you can choose <strong>only this form</strong> to be submitted, or you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong> meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved.</li><li><strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable a) reassignment, b) edit, and c) custom actions on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</li></ol><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced the principles of working with forms.

For example if an employee submits a performance review form, a line manager may wish to access that submitted process instance/record and edit the form, adding in comments and performance grades.</p><p>There are two key principles to keep in mind in terms of <strong>form access</strong>:</p><ol><li><p>Forms are <strong>assignable</strong> - this means that forms can be assigned to individuals and/or groups, and then only they can <strong>edit</strong> the form, when it is the current form, in a process instance. The &lsquo;assignee&rsquo; can be a combination of users and groups. There are various ways a form can be assigned to a user:</p><p>​ a) Using <strong>Rules</strong>, in particular the Workflow rule <strong>Assign form</strong>, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> for details</p><p>​ b) Using <strong>Quick actions</strong>, see <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/>Form Quick action</a> for details</p><p>​ c) Creating <strong>form owners</strong> when creating or updating a process design, see <a href=#creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</a> for details</p></li><li><p><strong>Only form owners</strong> can edit a given form when it is a <strong>current form</strong> in a process flow by <strong>default</strong>. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</p></li></ol><p>So what is <strong>form owner</strong>? A form owner is assigned when a form is created in Kianda <strong>Designer</strong>. Form owners can also be added to a form design at a later stage by editing the form. Only the form owner will be able to <strong>edit current forms</strong> in <strong>process instances</strong> (records), see below.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-form-owners>Getting started with Form owners</h2><h3 id=creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</h3><ol><li>Click on a process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on an existing process or create a new process by clicking on <strong>Add new</strong> and complete the <strong>Add new process</strong> dialog box.</li><li>Then within Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> click on a form of interest and then click on the <strong>Edit/(Pen)</strong> <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit/Pen button"> button for that form.</li><li>In the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box you can add form owners in the <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/new-form-owners.jpg alt="Partner account details attributes"></p><p>​ Using the dropdown list choose from:</p><ul><li><strong>Users</strong> - Users must already be in the system, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/users/>Users & Groups</a></li><li><strong>Groups</strong> - Groups must be defined in advance, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/users/>Users & Groups</a></li><li><strong>Partners</strong> - Partners must be already in the system and active, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/b2b-portals/>B2B portals</a></li></ul><ol start=4><li>If you make a mistake, or form owners need to be changed in an existing process, click on the <strong>x</strong> beside the name of the <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> or <strong>Partners</strong> to remove them and choose from the dropdown list again.</li><li>Add to or edit the remaining parameters in the dialog box as desired, see <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/designer/#editing-forms>Editing forms</a> and click on <strong>OK</strong> when complete, or <strong>Close</strong> to exit the dialog box at any time.</li></ol><h2 id=changing-form-access>Changing form access</h2><p>The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to using the <strong>default owner field</strong> in the <strong>new form</strong> dialog box as shown above.

The next section details how to <a href=#changing-default-owners>Change default owners</a>.</p><p>It is also possible to allow other users to have edit access to forms using the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign rule</a> and <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/>Quick actions</a>.</p><h3 id=changing-default-owners>Changing default owners</h3><ol><li><p>Using your <strong>Administration</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong> role, go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> > select a process > select a form in the process.</p></li><li><p>Click on the form so the <strong>Edit/Pen</strong> button appears in the form name.</p><p><img src=/images/select-form-to-edit.jpg alt="Select form to edit"></p></li><li><p>Then click on the <strong>Edit/Pen</strong> button itself to edit the form.</p></li><li><p>An <strong>Edit form</strong> dialog box opens which has the same layout as the <strong>New form</strong> dialog box seen in <a href=#creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</a> above.</p><p><img src=/images/edit-form-dialog-box.jpg alt="Edit form dialog box"></p></li><li><p>Here you can change the default owner choosing from <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> and <strong>Partners</strong> as before.</p></li></ol><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To learn more about rules including <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign rule</a> go to <a href=/docs/platform/rules/>Rules</a>.</p><p>To find out how forms work within processes go to <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/process/>Process</a>.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-f2ca3086a88c04d95af05e5755cb758d>2.2 - Form display modes</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Remember there are three principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ul><li><strong>Reading modes</strong>: <strong>Form users</strong> can either use forms in <strong>edit</strong> mode or <strong>read</strong> mode.

The actions below refer to making forms <strong>editable</strong> so if the actions below are not used, then the forms are in <strong>read mode</strong>. The actions below refer to static or fixed use, set when the form is first created or updated at a later time.</p><ol><li><p>Forms in process instances will be <strong>editable</strong> for <strong>Default owner(s)</strong>, that is the <strong>form owners</strong> defined when the form is created, or a form is edited. Form owners are defined in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, shown in part 1 of the image above. When a process instance runs, the form owner can then edit the form in that instance.</p></li><li><p>By default the <strong>first form</strong> in a process becomes the <strong>current form</strong>, so only this form will be <strong>editable</strong>. However if several forms are <strong>activated with</strong> the current form when the form is created or edited in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box shown above, then <strong>all forms in that group</strong> will be editable by the form owner in a process instance.</p></li><li><p>By default the <strong>Submit mode</strong> for forms is <strong>Only this form</strong> meaning that when a process instance is running you can choose <u>only</u> that particular form can have details submitted or saved. Alternatively you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong>, meaning that several forms can have their details submitted or saved. For example if several forms are activated together and all are in <strong>edit mode</strong> then the details of all these forms can be submitted together in the database.</p></li><li><p>Forms can be statically set to allow <strong>Quick actions</strong> including allowing <strong>editing</strong>. When a form is created or edited using the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, clicking on <strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable:</p><p>a) <strong>reassignment</strong> of forms</p><p>b) <strong>editing</strong> of forms</p><p>c) <strong>custom actions</strong> on any form</p><p>For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms.

This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</p></li></ol><h3 id=changing-form-display-dynamically-with-rules>Changing form display dynamically with rules</h3><p>If you use the <strong>Form action</strong> rule called <strong>Field display mode</strong>, you can change how a field or form displays <strong>dynamically</strong>. For example you have a condition set that the display will change based on the condition being present or not.</p><p>When you add this rule, under <strong>Action</strong> you can choose a field or form and choose from <strong>Edit mode</strong> or <strong>Read mode</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/field-display-rule.jpg alt="Field display rule"></p><p>For more information on this rule go to <a href=/docs/platform/rules/form-actions/field-display-mode/>Field Display mode rule</a>.</p><p>Other rules can be used in other ways to change process workflow and therefore how forms behave.

Processes can connect to your data sources like Sharepoint or SalesForce allowing for the flexibility of your applications to grow as your business grows.</p><p>Each process can be linked to <strong>dashboards</strong> so you can see at a glance, for example, how many leave requests were submitted, purchase orders approved and so on. And you can customise all of these processes the way you want.</p><p>Before you begin, we at Kianda recommend doing some simple planning before you design your process. It could be something as simple as a quick flow chart or a spreadsheet where you quickly log the key components, fields or rules that should be needed in the process.</p><h2 id=creating-processes>Creating processes</h2><ol><li><p>To start creating your first process, go to the side menu on the left of the screen and click on <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong>.</p></li><li><p>To create processes you can:</p><ul><li><p>Use Kianda&rsquo;s pre-defined processes or Apps, see <a href=#using-the-app-store>Using the App Store</a>.</p></li><li><p>Create your own processes from scratch, see <a href=#creating-your-own-processes>Creating your own processes</a>.</p></li><li><p>Import processes that are already created, see <a href=#importing-processes>Importing processes</a>.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>When you have created your process(es) go to <a href=#editing-processes>Editing processes</a> to find out how to start adding forms.</p></li><li><p>You can also export any processes for backup and reuse, see <a href=#exporting-processes>Exporting processes</a>.</p></li></ol><h3 id=using-the-app-store>Using the App Store</h3><ol><li><p>You can choose from Kianda&rsquo;s process templates by clicking on the <strong>App Store</strong> button <img src=/images/appstore.png alt="App Store button">.</p></li><li><p>Choose from <strong>General</strong>, <strong>IT</strong>, <strong>Customer Services</strong>, <strong>Finance</strong>, <strong>Travel</strong>, <strong>Quality</strong> and <strong>Accounting</strong> apps by clicking on the relevant button in the left-hand pane and then select an app from within that category, for example Customer Support Queries.</p><p><img src=/images/appstoreegs.png alt="App Store General Apps"></p></li><li><p>You can click on <strong>Read More</strong> to read about the app and click on <strong>Import Process App</strong> to import the process.</p><p><img src=/images/supportapp.png alt="Customer Support Queries App"></p></li><li><p>If the process is an existing process, you can choose to override the existing process by clicking <strong>Yes</strong> or if not, click <strong>No</strong>.

To read more about process instances and settings go to the links below:</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-60eb5e695513b9a33c8bb16760f82262>3.1 - Process instance</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Kianda processes are made up of <strong>forms</strong>, which in turn contain <strong>fields</strong> or <strong>controls</strong> and <strong>rules</strong>. Fields are used to take in user input, make calculations, display values and so on, and rules are used to execute actions to drive the process.</p><p><strong>Kianda Designer</strong> is used to create these forms and form elements within a process. Each process in Kianda Designer will have it’s own unique link or URL and this can be shared with other form designers for co-creation, for example, for a process named ‘Training process’ the link is:</p><p><a href=https://green-itr.kianda.com/admin/designer/training-process>https://green-itr.kianda.com/admin/designer/training-process</a></p><h2 id=process-instances>Process instances</h2><p>When your process is created in Kianda Designer, you can save the process, and then <strong>submit data</strong> to that process. When you save or submit data, then an <strong>instance</strong> of the process is created. Another name for a process instance is a <strong>record</strong>. This instance is tied to user data or calculated values, or to whatever the process is designed to do.</p><p>The instance has a unique ID which can be seen in a list widget in a <strong>dashboard</strong>. For example, this List widget displays the individual records of various training requests submitted by employees. The unique ID for each record is shown in the first column. Form owners or those with security access can click on ID ‘training-request-and-feedback-process-26’ to view the training request form completed and submitted by employee Mark Donnelli.</p><p><em><strong>List widget in a dashboard showing process instances</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/process-instance.jpg alt="Process instance example"></p><p>This means that each new record generated by a process will have its own unique URL that can be shared with those who have the required security access and need to be involved in that <strong>particular process instance</strong>. For example, in this case, the training request submitted by Mark (an employee) may be viewed and approved by his line manager:</p><p><a href=https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/training-request-and-feedback-process-26>https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/training-request-and-feedback-process-26</a></p><p>You can create a link on your dashboard – in the example shown above, the <strong>Start new process</strong> button at the top right of the Training Requests list widget – that enables you to create a <strong>new record</strong> by bringing you into the relevant form. For information on creating list widgets go to <a href=docs/platform/pages/list/>List widget</a>.</p><p>If you commit to the process by <strong>submitting or saving information</strong>, then the result is a new process instance – that is, a new unique record – which will be seen in a list widget in the dashboard, as seen in the image above.</p><p>Keeping in mind that Designer is used to create processes, and that each ‘run’ of the process design results in a unique process instance or record, will help you later on when designing forms and dashboards.

The fields you add in, such as a text box, list or button are called <strong>Design fields</strong>. For example as seen in <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/process/properties/#field-properties>Field properties</a> you can change properties for a textbox field, like making the field <strong>Required</strong> and <strong>Visible</strong> for form users as shown in the image below for the Training Request form field called &lsquo;Employee Name&rsquo;</p><p><img src=/images/settingsprocess.png alt=.></p><p>These design fields are also apparent when creating <strong>dashboards</strong>, for example <strong>list</strong> widgets. In the example below we can see the <strong>Design fields</strong> highlighted that are found in the Training Request form. These highlighted fields like <strong>Employee Name</strong> will appear in the list widget in the dashboard.</p><p><img src=/images/design-fields-example.jpg alt="Example of design fields in a list widget"></p><p>Clicking on <strong>List fields</strong> in list widget shown above will <strong>show all the fields</strong> that will appear in the widget.</p><p><img src=/images/list-field-defaults.jpg alt="List field example"></p><p>Note that non Design fields are also included in the fields to display, namely <strong>ID</strong>, <strong>Process Name</strong> and <strong>Modified</strong> fields. These fields are part of the set of <strong>Common fields</strong> associated with all Kianda processes.</p><h2 id=common-fields>Common fields</h2><p>The non-design fields associated with all Kianda processes are listed below. It is useful to keep these fields in mind when designing forms, as they can be used to retrieve, store or display values from <strong>process instances</strong> for example <strong>Status</strong> which is the status of a process instance. Using these &lsquo;internal values&rsquo; could be useful where the status of one process could be used as a condition to trigger the start of another process, for example using the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/start-a-process/><strong>Start a process</strong></a> rule.</p><p>The common fields associated with process instances are:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Field name</th><th>Explanation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>ID</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>process instance ID</strong>, labelled as &lsquo;process-name-number&rsquo;, for example &lsquo;safety-inspection-8&rsquo;. This ID is part of the URL that brings you to the process instance/record held on the system when information is either submitted or saved. For example clicking on the process instance ID &lsquo;safety-inspection-8&rsquo; in a dashboard brings you to the form for example &lsquo;<a href="https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/safety-inspection-8'">https://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/safety-inspection-8'</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Unique ID</strong></td><td>This is a <strong>system generated ID</strong> for each process instance, a 32 letter and number generated value.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Status</strong></td><td>This is the status for the process instance, that is either a &lsquo;<strong>form name</strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<strong>Completed</strong>&rsquo;. Completed indicates that all forms in a process have been submitted, while &lsquo;form name&rsquo; indicates what the active form is in the process, that is, where the process is &lsquo;at&rsquo;. For example in a process of two forms, a Request form and an Approval form. Once the Request form has been submitted then the status for a process is &lsquo;Approval form&rsquo; indicating that this form needs to be completed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Version</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>process instance version number</strong> that starts as 1.0. If a process instance is updated, for example if a process design is updated and published and process instances are updated with the change, then the next version of the instance will be 2.0.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Process Version</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>process design version</strong>, that is the version of the process design that has been used as a template for the process instance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Process Name</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>Unique ID name</strong> that comes from the process design that is the template for the process instance. The ID is created when the process is created. The ID field autofills from the title of the process as shown in <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/#creating-your-first-process>Create your first process</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Process Title</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>Process title</strong> that comes from the process design title, created when the process is created or updated, for example see <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/#creating-your-first-process>Create your first process</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Created</strong></td><td>This is a <strong>date and time stamp</strong> when the process instance is created.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Created by</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>user name</strong> of the user who <strong>created</strong> the process instance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Modified</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>date and time stamp</strong> when the process instance is modified, for example after a process design is published and existing process instances are updated.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Modified by</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>user name</strong> of the user who <strong>modified</strong> the process instance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Assign to</strong></td><td>This is the <strong>user name</strong> of the user who a process is <strong>assigned</strong> to. Process designs may have a static option for reassignment in their design so that process instances can be reassigned using <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/#how-to-get-started>Quick actions</a>. Alternatively the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> rule can be used to dynamically assign form ownership to another user. That user is named in the <strong>Assign to</strong> field.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Security users</strong></td><td>These are the named security users, defined using <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/process/settings/#process-settings><strong>Process settings</strong></a> by selecting <strong>Enable process security</strong> and naming <strong>Process security users</strong> which can be <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> and/or <strong>Partners</strong>.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><ul><li>To learn more about design controls that can be applied to forms go to <a href=/docs/platform/controls/><strong>Controls</strong></a>.</li><li>To learn more about how common fields are displayed in dashboards in a list widget go to <a href=/docs/platform/pages/list/><strong>List widget</strong></a>.</li></ul></div></main></div></div><footer class="bg-dark py-5 row d-print-none"><div class="container-fluid mx-sm-5"><div class=row><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-xs-center order-sm-2"><ul class="list-inline mb-0"><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Twitter aria-label=Twitter><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://twitter.com/kiandaBPM aria-label=Twitter><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-right text-xs-center order-sm-3"><ul class="list-inline mb-0"><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=GitHub aria-label=GitHub><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://github.com/kiandaBPM aria-label=GitHub><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></li><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Discord aria-label=Discord><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://discord.gg/uDSW6qcYub aria-label=Discord><i class="fab fa-discord"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="col-12 col-sm-4 text-center py-2 order-sm-2"><small class=text-white>&copy; 2022 Kianda Technologies All Rights Reserved</small>
