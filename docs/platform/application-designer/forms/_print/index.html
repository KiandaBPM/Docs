For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</li></ol><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced the principles of working with forms.

For example if an employee submits a performance review form, a line manager may wish to access that submitted process instance/record and edit the form, adding in comments and performance grades.</p><p>There are two key principles to keep in mind in terms of <strong>form access</strong>:</p><ol><li><p>Forms are <strong>assignable</strong> - this means that only a form assignee, that is, someone that is assigned to a form, can <strong>edit</strong> a particular form in a process instance. The &lsquo;assignee&rsquo; can be a combination of users and groups. There are various ways a form can be assigned to a user</p><p>​ a) Using <strong>Rules</strong>, in particular the Workflow rule Assign form, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> for details</p><p>​ b) Using <strong>Quick actions</strong>, see <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/>Form Quick action</a> for details</p><p>​ c) Creating <strong>form owners</strong> when creating or updating a process design, see <a href=#creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</a> for details</p></li><li><p><strong>Only form owners</strong> can edit a given form by <strong>default</strong>. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</p></li></ol><p>So what is <strong>form owner</strong>? A form owner is assigned when a form is created in Kianda Designer or form owners can be added to a process design at a later stage. Only the form owner will be able to edit <strong>process instances</strong> (records).</p><p>Once a process has been designed and users can initiate new process instances or records from a dashboard page, then the only people who can edit process records are the form owners or someone who has had the record assigned to them. For example, a line manager who is a form owner may need to add additional information about work goals in an appraisal form that their employee has already filled out.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-form-owners>Getting started with Form owners</h2><h3 id=creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</h3><ol><li>Click on a process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on an existing process or create a new process by clicking on <strong>Add new</strong> and complete the <strong>Add new process</strong> dialog box.</li><li>Then within Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> click on a form of interest and then click on the <strong>Edit/(Pen)</strong> <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit/Pen button"> button for that form.</li><li>In the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box you can add form owners in the <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/new-form-owners.jpg alt="Partner account details attributes"></p><p>​ Using the dropdown list choose from:</p><ul><li><strong>Users</strong> - Users must already be in the system, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/users/>Users & Groups</a></li><li><strong>Groups</strong> - Groups must be defined in advance, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/users/>Users & Groups</a></li><li><strong>Partners</strong> - Partners must be already in the system and active, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/b2b-portals/>B2B portals</a></li></ul><ol start=4><li>If you make a mistake, or form owners need to be changed in an existing process, click on the <strong>x</strong> beside the name of the <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> or <strong>Partners</strong> to remove them and choose from the dropdown list again.</li><li>Add to or edit the remaining parameters in the dialog box as desired, see <a href=#editing-forms/docs/platform/application-designer/designer/>Editing forms</a> and click on <strong>OK</strong> when complete, or <strong>Close</strong> to exit the dialog box at any time.</li></ol><h3 id=form-ownership-and-process-instances>Form ownership and process instances</h3><p>The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to <strong>when the the form is created</strong>.

The actions below refer to making forms <strong>editable</strong> so if the actions below are not used, then the forms are in <strong>read mode</strong>.</p><ol><li>Forms in process instances will be <strong>editable</strong> for <strong>Default owner(s)</strong>, that is the <strong>form owners</strong> defined when the form is created, or a form is edited. Form owners are defined in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, shown in part 1 of the image above. When a process instance runs, the form owner can then edit the form in that instance.</li><li>By default the first form in a process becomes the <strong>current form</strong>, so only this form will be <strong>editable</strong> for form owners. However if several forms are <strong>activated with</strong> the current form, defined when the form is created or edited in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, then <strong>all forms in that group</strong> will be editable by the form owner in a process instance, as shown in part 2 of the image above.</li><li>By default the <strong>Submit mode</strong> is <strong>only this form</strong> meaning that when a process instance is running you can choose only that particular form can have details submitted. Alternatively you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong> meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved. For example if several forms are activated together and all are in <strong>edit mode</strong> then the details of all these forms can be submitted together.</li><li>Forms can be statically set to allow <strong>Quick actions</strong> including allowing <strong>editing</strong>. When a form is created or edited using the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, clicking on <strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable a) <strong>reassignment</strong>, b) <strong>edit</strong>, and c) <strong>custom actions</strong> on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means the user(s) assigns the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</li></ol><h3 id=changing-form-display-with-rules>Changing form display with rules</h3><p>If you use the <strong>Form action</strong> rule called <strong>Field display mode</strong> you can change how a field or form displays dynamically.</p><p>When you add this rule, under <strong>Action</strong> you can choose a field or form and choose from <strong>Edit mode</strong> or <strong>Read mode</strong>.
