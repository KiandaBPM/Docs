There are 7 workflow rules, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/>Workflow</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Communications</strong> - rules associated with user communication for example sending an email, meeting request or triggering a user alert. There are 4 communication rules, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/communications/>Communications</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Data</strong> - rules associated with database operations Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) allowing these actions to occur on configured data sources. There are 5 data rules, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/data/>Data</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Users</strong> - rules associated with user properties, allowing user lookup based on a user attribute or retrieve a user property. There are 4 user rules, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/users/>Users</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>File management</strong> - rules concerned with generating documents such as Word, Excel or converting to PDF. There are 7 file management rules, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/files/>File Management</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Tables</strong> - rules associated with table operations such as sorting, copying table rows to another table, adding and removing table rows. There are 12 table rules, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/tables/>Tables</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Dates</strong> - date rules to calculate time and format dates with advanced filter options like omitting weekends or special dates . There are 4 date rules, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/dates/>Dates</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>Form actions</strong> - rules linked to actions that are part of forms, for example submit, close or save. There are 6 form rules, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/form-actions/>Form actions</a> for more information.</li><li><strong>SharePoint</strong> - SharePoint associated rules such as adding, finding or removing users, defining permissions and check-in/checkout of an item.

the order of rules on a <strong>Submit</strong> button could be: Set Status, Send Email, Submit, Save, Close, whereby the status of the process instance is set first, before an automated email and then the form shutdown rules of Submit, Save and Close occur.</p><p>To read more about multiple rules, go to <a href=/docs/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a>.</p></li></ol><h2 id=conditions>Conditions</h2><p>Flexible and dynamic conditions form an important component to make forms fully dynamic.

Click on the links below to read more about rule concepts in detail:</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-5a17b773fd22fa69d901fb947f720369>1.1 - Conditions</h1><p>Conditions are a key component of Kianda <strong>rules</strong>. They are the <strong>triggers</strong> that result in fully dynamic forms. They enable you to enables you to create natural language conditions when rules should be triggered.</p><p>The <strong>Conditions</strong> button <img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/condition.png alt=img> is found within all <strong>rules</strong> as well as <a href=docs/platform/pages/>dashboard widgets</a>. Conditions can also be set when setting data source security levels for <a href=/docs/platform/b2b-portals/data-access/>B2B portals</a>.</p><p>Conditions add an important level of interactivity, creating dynamic pathways within a process. These pathways could result from user interaction or from other events that happen.</p><p>Conditions work on the ‘if…then’ principle: ‘if’ the condition exists ‘then’ an action happens, and where applicable, if the condition does not exist, then another action can happen. You can use these principles as steps to implementing conditions:</p><ol><li>Create the <strong>condition(s)</strong></li><li>Create the <strong>action(s)</strong> that will be applied as a result of the first condition being in place.</li><li>Where applicable, create the <strong>otherwise action(s)</strong> based on other conditions being in place.</li></ol><h2 id=create-the-condition>Create the condition</h2><ol><li><p>To create <strong>conditions</strong>, first choose the <strong>process element</strong> you want the condition to apply to – such as a form, set of forms, a field/control or set of fields. This could also be a set of common fields associated with all process instances, such as <strong>Process ID</strong>, <strong>Status</strong> or <strong>Modified by</strong>, see image below.</p><p><img src=/images/common-fields-in-condition.jpg alt="Common fields used in the process element part of a condition"></p></li><li><p>Next, depending on whether the rule is applied to a <strong>text-based field or date-based field</strong>, choose from 13 text operators or 25 date operators (see image below).</p></li><li><p>Then choose a <strong>value</strong>, this could be typed in text, number(s), date(s), form(s) or field(s).</p></li></ol><p><em><strong>Condition elements</strong></em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/conditions3-2.gif alt=img></p><p>In the case of <strong>multiple conditions</strong>, you can use <strong>And</strong> or <strong>Or</strong> to create a group of compound conditions:</p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/editconditions-1.gif alt=img></p><p>The result is a flexible process workflow that will result in desired actions based on any number of conditions.</p><h3 id=rule-actions--example-hide-or-disable-rule>Rule action(s) – example Hide or Disable rule</h3><p>To create <strong>actions</strong> and where applicable, <strong>otherwise actions</strong>, the <strong>action will depend on the rule</strong> that is chosen. All Kianda rules use a natural language structure to make it is easy to apply actions. For example, for the <strong>Workflow rule</strong>, <strong>Hide or Disable</strong>, you can choose forms and fields from your process and then apply seven possible actions (as shown below).</p><p>*<strong>Action elements for Hide or Disable*</strong></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hideoptions-1024x477.gif alt="7 actions for Hide or Disable"></p><p>The actions within <strong>Hide or disable</strong> are:</p><ul><li><strong>Hide</strong> will hide a process element (forms or fields) from view.</li><li><strong>Show</strong> will show the element.</li><li><strong>Disable</strong> blocks a user from editing an element.</li><li><strong>Enable</strong> allows a user to add a value to an element.</li><li><strong>Toggle visible</strong> will toggle between showing an element or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to.</li><li><strong>Toggle enable</strong> will toggle between allowing an element to be edited or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to.</li><li><strong>Hide and clear</strong> will allow you to hide a process element and clear the details. For example, if a toggle button has this rule applied, with an <strong>otherwise action</strong> of <strong>show</strong> on a textbox, then if one value is chosen on the toggle button, the user is allowed enter details into the textbox. The otherwise action is that the field is hidden and cleared of data, so that no data can be retrieved. This might be useful, for example, when sensitive information is used, like a social security number on a form.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can use rules to create <strong>actions</strong> <strong>without conditions</strong> too. In this case the rule will simply execute, for example when a form or field is clicked on.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>Depending on how the rule is applied, for example to a <strong>Submit</strong> button, the rule order is important to consider, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/general/mutiple-rules/>Multiple rules</a>.</p><p>To find out more about rule implementation, go to the main <a href=/docs/platform/rules/>Rules</a> page and then click on the links to the different rule categories.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-3ff330dcdeb484d3b41991547f27fafe>1.2 - Multiple rules</h1><p>When working with rules in forms, a key principle to consider is <strong>rule order</strong>. Rule order is important if there are <strong>multiple rules</strong> attached to an item like a button to determine the sequence of rule execution. As a form designer you can change the order of execution is important and modified form and process designs, including rule order to suit your needs.</p><h2 id=rule-order-example>Rule order example</h2><p>For example, you may want a process to send automated emails to a safety manager, where the email includes submitted form data. In this case a <strong>Send email rule</strong> could be attached to a form <strong>Submit</strong> button so an email is sent once the button is clicked. This will result in an automated email to a designated person. To generate a report of the completed form you can use the <strong>Generate word</strong> <strong>document</strong> <strong>rule</strong> triggered again when the <strong>Submit</strong> button is clicked. In this example the <strong>Generate word document rule</strong> has to be executed <u>before</u> the <strong>Send email rule</strong>, so that the Word document can be generated and then attached to the email.</p><p>The rule order consideration is therefore particularly important when rules are <strong>dependent</strong> on each other - where the output of one rule is the input of another rule.</p><h2 id=changing-the-rule-order-of-multiple-rules>Changing the rule order of multiple rules</h2><p>In the example below we will look at changing the rule order of a Send email rule attached to a Submit button. The <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> buttons by default already have <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> process rules attached, in order to allow form shutdown.</p><p>To change rule order, when the rule is created:</p><ol><li>Click on the item that has multiple rules attached, for example a <strong>Submit</strong> button. Remember by default Submit buttons in forms will have &lsquo;form shutdown&rsquo; rules, namely <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Rules</strong> in the right-hand pane, drag the <strong>Send email</strong> rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and drag it to the top of the list, before <strong>Submit</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> rules.</li></ol><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ruleorder_frame.png alt=img></p><p>The video below shows an example of a <strong>Send email rule</strong> being created and saved. The rule is attached to the <strong>Submit</strong> button. Once the rule is created, by default the new rule goes to the bottom of the list of rules. To move the rule, simply click on it and drag it to where you wish to place it. In this example we want the email sent <u>before</u> any of the shutdown processes like Submit or Save, but after a <strong>Generate Inspection</strong> rule, so the output from that rule can be used in the Send email rule.</p><video width=100% style=width:100% controls>
