&lt;p>You can &lt;strong>generate reports&lt;/strong> within Kianda processes and &lt;strong>populate&lt;/strong> the reports with &lt;strong>data captured&lt;/strong> within each process instance. This could be useful, for example, for inspection reports where a report template can be used to show the information the engineer input to a &lt;strong>Kianda form&lt;/strong> during his inspection. Each time an inspection is performed, a report is generated based on a Word template and the report shows the relevant information that was captured during that particular inspection.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There is also a Kianda Add-in for Excel that is added in the same way as the Kianda Add-in for Word. Usage is very similar allowing you to connect an Excel spreadsheet to Kianda processes to create a template that can be used within processes.
