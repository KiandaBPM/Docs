&lt;p>In this example we will show how we can create a Nonconformance Process and step through the logic behind the rules and fields within each of the forms:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a &lt;strong>Nonconformity Details Form&lt;/strong> which is completed by a company employee, reporting a nonconformance within a company.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>an &lt;strong>Auditor Review Form&lt;/strong> which will be completed by an &lt;strong>Auditor&lt;/strong> that reviews the nonconformance and has the ability to create an action plan along with individual actions that will be sent via email to responsible employees.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>an &lt;strong>Action Confirmation Form&lt;/strong> which will be completed by a supervisor within the company. This form is used to confirm that all actions from the auditor review form were completed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a &lt;strong>Closure Form&lt;/strong> which is completed by a manager within the company. This form is used to select the outcome of the plan to resolve the nonconformance.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The result at the end of the process is an email to both the originator and a site manager, who receive a &lt;strong>PDF&lt;/strong> report of the nonconformance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The process will use &lt;strong>utility panels&lt;/strong> to hold form fields and values, not visible to the end user, but these will be used with rules to automate the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can download the process file which you will be able to &lt;a href="https://docs.kianda.com/docs/how-to/reuse-or-clone-process-elements/">import&lt;/a> to your own subscription and examine the process in full detail.

&lt;p>This section describes the purpose of the &lt;strong>Nonconformance details&lt;/strong> form, and outlines the type of information that is captured. In this form we will focus our attention to an &lt;a href="https://docs.kianda.com/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/">Assign form&lt;/a> rule and a &lt;a href="https://docs.kianda.com/docs/platform/rules/communications/send-email/">Send email&lt;/a> rule. We will be using the send email rule across the process and therefore the logic behind implementing it will be the same. We will also focus on a &lt;strong>Configuration&lt;/strong> panel that will be invisible to users. We will use the panel to store a template for our report and have a few fields that will help us when creating a name for the report. In combination with our &lt;strong>Closure&lt;/strong> form, we will also take a quick look at the &lt;a href="https://docs.kianda.com/docs/platform/document-generation/word-document-add-in/">Kianda Word add-in&lt;/a> to create a template for our report.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="auditor-review">Auditor review&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This section describes the purpose of the &lt;strong>Auditor review&lt;/strong> form, and outlines the type of information that is captured. In this form we will focus our attention on individual actions that the &lt;strong>Auditor&lt;/strong> can create to match his &lt;strong>Plan&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Implementation&lt;/strong>. We will use a &lt;a href="https://docs.kianda.com/docs/platform/controls/input/table/">Table&lt;/a> and a &lt;a href="https://docs.kianda.com/docs/platform/controls/layout/dialog/">Dialog&lt;/a> fields as well as a &lt;a href="https://docs.kianda.com/docs/platform/rules/tables/loop-table/">Loop table&lt;/a> rule to create the desired functionality.&lt;/p>

In this form we will focus our attention on a &lt;a href="https://docs.kianda.com/docs/platform/controls/layout/field-group/">Field group&lt;/a> that allows us to mirror fields from different forms within our process and group them together. The &lt;strong>Field group&lt;/strong> prevents us from &lt;strong>re-creating&lt;/strong> fields as the values from the original field will be copied into the field inside of the field group.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can also examine how a dashboard was made for our Inspection process example by going to &lt;a href="https://docs.kianda.com/docs/examples/inspection/dashboard/">Simple Inspection process&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="whats-next--idea-iconimages18png">What&amp;rsquo;s next &lt;img src="https://docs.kianda.com/images/18.png" alt="Idea icon">&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can create a &lt;strong>Dashboard page&lt;/strong> to show the status completion of the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This process is available as a downloadable .kianda file here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Simple Inspection process</title><link>https://docs.kianda.com/docs/examples/inspection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.kianda.com/docs/examples/inspection/</guid><description>
&lt;p>In this example we will step through how to create a simple Inspection process made up of two forms:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a &lt;strong>Request form&lt;/strong> which is completed by a company employee, requesting an engineer to visit a specific location to perform an inspection&lt;/li>
&lt;li>an &lt;strong>Inspection form&lt;/strong> which contains the inspection checklist that the engineer must complete&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The result at the end of the process is an email to a designated Safety manager, who receives a PDF report of the inspection form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The process will use &lt;strong>utility panels&lt;/strong> to hold form fields and values, not visible to the end user, but these will be used with rules to automate the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following image is a step by step roadmap of our process: &lt;img src="https://docs.kianda.com/images/inspection-process-roadmap.jpg" alt="Inspection process">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creating-a-new-process">Creating a new process&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can create an Inspection process if you have the role &lt;strong>Administrator&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>Designer&lt;/strong> by going to the left-hand side menu and click on &lt;strong>Administration&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Designer&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>When you are in process designer window, click on &lt;strong>Add new&lt;/strong> button to start a new process. This button can be found at the top of the screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Add new process&lt;/strong> window appears with the following fields to fill out:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Title&lt;/strong> - represents the name of your process which is also the displayed name for other users.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ID (unique)&lt;/strong> - A unique ID which is used to identify your process.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Description&lt;/strong> - Piece of text to describe your new process.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Group&lt;/strong> - A group which you want your new process to belong to.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If a group already exist, it will simply add your new process to that group.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the group does not exist, it will make a folder for you and automatically add the process to that group.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Administrators&lt;/strong> - In this field you can choose to add &lt;strong>Users&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Groups&lt;/strong> to be administrators of the new process. This field determines who can edit and make changes to your process.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://docs.kianda.com/images/examples-new-process.jpg" alt="Add new process window">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>After you fill out the information needed, press &lt;strong>OK&lt;/strong>. You are automatically brought into a &lt;strong>blank&lt;/strong> process creation page, which looks as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://docs.kianda.com/images/examples-process-creation-page.jpg" alt="Process creation page">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="planning-form-requirements">Planning Form Requirements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the example of the Inspection process we already discussed, we will need two forms: 1) Request form and 2) Inspection form. For our process, we need to make a list of requirements for the information we need to capture in each form. The information that will be provided to users in each form, for example a what company and location the inspection needs to be completed in. To learn more about planning process requirements, go to &lt;a href="https://docs.kianda.com/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/">Planning your process&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="whats-next-idea-iconimages18png">What&amp;rsquo;s next &lt;img src="https://docs.kianda.com/images/18.png" alt="Idea icon">&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now that we have a list of all our requirements for this process, we can continue on by creating our first form. To learn more on how to create the &lt;strong>Request Form&lt;/strong> step by step, go to &lt;a href="https://docs.kianda.com/docs/examples/inspection/request-form/">Creating Request Form&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
