# Panel field

A **panel** is section of a form. Panels hold other fields like lists and text boxes. It is a good idea when first creating a form to insert a panel and from there to insert other control fields.

 

## How to get started

1. To add a panel to your form click on **Controls** > **Layout** > **Panel**.

2. To edit panel click on the panel itself, click on the field itself and the Pen icon ![Pen icon](images/penicon.png) appears allowing you to edit the panel.

3. Choose from the edit options:

   - **Title** - of the panel, for example Section 1

   - **Name** - this is a unique name for the field

   - **Help text** - information to help the form user

   - **Layout columns** - control the size of the panel. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a panel that is 6 columns wide, or click on the right of the blue bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.
