# Panel field

A **panel** is section of a form. Panels hold other fields like lists and text boxes. It is a good idea when first creating a form to insert a panel and from there to insert other control fields.

 

## How to get started

1. To add a panel to your form click on **Controls** > **Layout** > **Panel**.

2. To edit the panel click on the panel itself and the **Pen** button ![Pen icon](images/penicon.png) appears allowing you to edit the panel.

3. Choose from the edit options:

   - **Title** - of the panel, for example Section 1

   - **Name** - this is a unique name for the field

   - **Help text** - information to help the form user

   - **Layout columns** - control the size of the panel, choose from 1 to 12 columns in width. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a panel that is 6 columns wide, or click on the right of the blue bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.

   - **Colour scheme** - choose from 6 different colour options: navy, green, blue, amber, red, white

   - **Enable panel security** - choose from Yes or No

4. Click on the **OK** button ![OK button](images/ok.png) when you are finished editing the panel.

5. To move the panel, click on the **Drag handle** in the panel itself ![Move button](images/move.png) and drag the panel to where you want it to appear on the form.

6. To save your changes, click on the **Save** button ![Save button](images/saveprocess.png).

7. To delete the panel, click on the panel itself and then click on the **Bin/Trash** button ![Bin or Trash icon](images/binicon.png) and then click on **Ok** after you have reviewed the field name and are sure this is what you want to delete. Click on **Cancel** if you wish to cancel the deletion.

7. You are now ready to add elements to your panel, for example a textbox, table or other fields, as well as rules. Go to [Controls](fields/README.md) to see the full list of fields available and [Rules](rules/README.md) to read about different categories of rules that can be applied.
