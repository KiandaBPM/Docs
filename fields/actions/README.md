# Actions #

Action fields are one category of [controls](fields/Readme.md) and include the fields that allow user interface actions like buttons or links. 



## Getting started with Action fields ##

If you go to **Administration** > **Designer** and click on a process or create a new process, then click on **Controls** the action fields are found in the left-hand pane when you click on **Action**.

There are 4 types of action fields as follows:

- **Button** - buttons can be applied to forms to allow user interaction, see [Button](button.md) for more information.

- **Link** - 

- **Image** -  see [Richtext](richtext.md) for more information.

- **Signature** - applying this field provides a very neat way to electronically sign-off on a form or process, see [Signature](signature.md) for more information.
