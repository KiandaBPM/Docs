# Controls

**Controls** are predefined field widgets that allow you to add specific elements to your forms and processes such as lists, text boxes and tables. 

If you have developer skills,  you can create your own custom field widget, see [Development](development/Readme.md) for more information.

## Getting started with Controls ##

If you go to **Administration** > **Designer** and click on a process or create a new process, the predefined fields are found in the left-hand pane.
