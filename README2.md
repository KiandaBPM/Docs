# Welcome to Kianda

The Kianda platform is a modern **low-code** and **no-code** **development platform** providing anyone, even those without coding experience, the structures to digitise business **processes** resulting in beautiful mobile-ready web applications. You can also use the platform to create **dashboards** to monitor how processes are performing and gain key insights to improve your business overall. And you can **customise** all of this the way you want - no developer needed. However if you have coding experience, you can use the platform to build your own widgets too. 

In summary the Kianda platform provides an ideal interface for **rapid prototyping** and delivering outcomes quickly.

## Logging into your workspace ##

If your organisation already has a login, go to your given Kianda login page. If not, sign up for a free trial by going to https://app.kianda.com/signup. You will be prompted to confirm your email address and you can then login. The Kianda platform runs in the cloud, so you only need a web browser and can use any mobile device to login. 

When you login you will have access to the Kianda **workspace** where you can build end-to-end business processes, connect to datasources and view the results in real-time data dashboards.

The layout of the Kianda workspace is as follows:

1. **Company logo** - the top left-hand corner is reserved for uploading your company logos. If you click on the **Collapse navigation** button ![Collapse navigation button](images/navigation_frame.png) you will see the collapsed version of the company logo and collapsed side menu, giving you more real estate in the central view panel.

2. **Side menu** - This left-hand pane contains all the key functions to create and manage your business processes. From this menu you will start **creating** **processes**.

3. **Main view** - this central panel is the main view for any of the functions chosen from the side menu. Here you can **view and edit** processes and dashboards.

4. **Quick Action menu** - the top right-hand menu bar contains shortcuts to keep you updated and allows you to **add dashboard pages**.

Go to [Personalise your workspace](workspacepersonalise.md) to find out to change the look and feel as well as regional settings for your workspace.
