# First steps: Creating your first process

Creating your first process or application in Kianda starts with designing your first form. Forms can connect to any number of data sources or connectors at the same time.

Because Kianda is a forms-based process automation platform it all starts with a form. It might be a simple contact form or something else more complex, but soon you will be able to add more forms like "Follow-up form" or even a "Closure form".

Although Kianda aims to be intuitive and easy to get started it is never difficult to over-engineer. So at Kianda we always recommend doing some simple planning before you design your first form.

It could be something as simple as a quick flow chart or as we use a spreadsheet where you quickly log the key components, fields or rules that should be needed in the process.

In general, we normally include the following key steps to build a process in an agile manner:

1. Plan process design, forms, fields, rules, log into design spreadsheet.
2. Build forms and fields connecting to data where applicable.
3. Publish to dashboards, anonymous forms or SharePoint for end-user distribution.
4. Repeat until perfect.
