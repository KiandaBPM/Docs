#  How does Kianda work

The Kianda platform no-code / low-code (NCLC) platform is created with the ultimate flexibility and agility in mind, allowing simple user interactions to build complex processes.

Kianda has been constructed using an **Model, View, Controller (MVC) approach** (Model, View, Controller). This approach allows designers to build mobile-responsive applications via **rapid User Interface (UI) prototyping**. The UI provides an easy way to build an application by clicking, scrolling, and drag and drop of fields. The layout both provides a way of building the application or process schema, and for capturing and monitoring data at run-time.

Some of the underlying technologies used within the platform include CSS3, HTML5, EmberJS, WebApi and NodeJS. 

Using a MVC approach allows that data, captured within forms and fields, to instantly react or trigger declarative rules defined on fields, forms or at process level via the **rules engine**. This combined with conditional logic is used by designers to build ambitious progressive web applications or end-to-end digital business processes that offer both a great UI and high performance.

> In Kianda one of the most important components that is worth emphasis is the [**rules engine**.](/rules/)  

### In a nutshell the **rules-engine** is made of:

1. Rule blocks - These are blocks that unlocks specific functionality using a toolkit approach
2. Flexible and declarative conditional logic 

These two components (rule blocks and conditional logic) are used extensively and recursively by designers to build the required orchestration of actions or rules that react of interact with data to provide the required functionality for your apps or processes.

In summary the Kianda platform provides an ideal interface for rapid prototyping and delivering outcomes quickly.
