<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Processes in Kianda are made up of <strong>forms</strong>. Forms contain all the buttons, fields, and rule triggers needed to execute your process.</p><p>Using your <strong>Administrator</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong> role, you will use Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> to design <strong>forms</strong> for <strong>end users</strong> who will use the platform to submit, save and review information, either as named users in the platform, users who receive a link to an anonymous form, or partners who can access shared processes. These end users will create new <strong>process instances</strong> or records in the system, or access <strong>existing process instances</strong> which shows information that has either been <strong>saved or submitted</strong> in a form.</p><p>When discussing forms we&rsquo;ll talk about <strong>form design</strong> that is creating and updating forms within a process using Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> as well <strong>form use</strong> which refers to end users who will edit or read forms in a process instance/record in the system, built using the <strong>Designer</strong>.</p><h2 id=form-design-principles>Form design principles</h2><p>As you work with Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> you are designing the &lsquo;user interface&rsquo; for users to interact with a particular process. Keeping the end user in mind, there are three design principles:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading modes</strong>: <strong>Form users</strong> can either use/access forms in <strong>edit</strong> mode or <strong>read</strong> mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review customer feedback in a form, but not be able to change/edit the feedback form.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Current form</strong>: Typically there are several forms in a process, and by default the <strong>first form</strong> in a process is the <strong>current form</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/3-form-example.jpg alt="Three form process example"></p><p>For example in the Training Attendance Process above, the process flow is as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Training Request</strong> - an employee initiates a process instance by filling out this form</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Training Approval</strong> - the manager approves the request using this form</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Training Attendance</strong> - when training approval occurs, a trainer invites the employee to attend training and once complete, the trainer completes a this form to evaluate the employee&rsquo;s participation.</p><p>Therefore when a process instance is initiated upon submission of the <strong>Training Request</strong> form, then the next form in the process becomes the <strong>current form</strong>, in this case the <strong>Training Approval</strong> form.</p><p>Only the form that has the status ‘<strong>current form’</strong> <strong>is editable</strong> by a form owner (see point 3 below). In a complex multi-step process, several forms can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form, meaning they are also editable at the same time, creating a <strong>form group</strong>, see section 2 of <a href=#new-form-creation>New form creation</a>. Rules can also be used to change the workflow and make other forms the &lsquo;current form&rsquo;.</p><p>Also note that <strong>all first forms</strong> in a process flow add the current user as a &lsquo;form owner&rsquo; therefore allowing <strong>all users</strong> to edit the first form, as clicking on &lsquo;submit&rsquo; or &lsquo;save&rsquo; in the first form results in a new process instance.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Form owner</strong>: The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to, this means they can <strong>edit the <u>current</u> form(s) in a process instance</strong>. Default owners are typically set when a form is created, see section 1 of <a href=#new-form-creation>New form creation</a> below. By default, <strong>only this person or group can edit the <u>current</u> form</strong> in a process instance. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups. Form ownership can also be assigned dynamically using the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> rule.</p></li></ol><p>These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below, and these parameters can be updated at any time by editing the form design. These properties can also change <strong>dynamically</strong> as a result of <strong>implementing rules</strong>, for example the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/go-to-form/>Go to form</a> rule can change the workflow in a process.</p><h3 id=new-form-creation>New form creation</h3><p>As mentioned in the <a href=#introduction>Introduction</a> there are certain considerations to keep in mind when working with forms. The image below shows a <strong>New form</strong> dialog box that is created when the <strong>Add form</strong> button is clicked in Kianda Designer. At any time if you click on a form and then the <strong>Edit/pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit/pen button"> an <strong>Edit form</strong> dialog box appears which has the same parameters as the one shown in the image below.</p><p><em><strong>New form dialog box</strong></em></p><p><img src=https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/newformsegments-1.gif alt=img></p><h5 id=new-form-considerations>New form considerations</h5><ol>
<li>The <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field is where you can set individuals and groups as the default <strong>form owners</strong> who can edit the form.</li><li><strong>Activate with</strong> means that the form can be activated with other forms within the process, so they can be edited at the same time. This means several forms become the <strong>current form</strong> in a form group.</li><li><strong>Submit mode</strong> means that when a process instance is running you can choose <strong>only this form</strong> to be submitted, or you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong> meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved.</li><li><strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable a) reassignment, b) edit, and c) custom actions on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</li></ol><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>We have briefly introduced the principles of working with forms.

<h1 id=pg-404a7910a619b430a8ebee5f57ce6cfc>1 - Form owners</h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>When creating forms, it is important to consider <strong>form access</strong> during the design phase, that is who can access and edit forms <strong>in a process instance</strong>. For example if an employee submits a performance review form, a line manager may wish to access that submitted process instance/record and edit the form, adding in comments and performance grades.</p><p>There are two key principles to keep in mind in terms of <strong>form access</strong>:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Forms are <strong>assignable</strong> - this means that forms can be assigned to individuals and/or groups, and then only they can <strong>edit</strong> the form, when it is the current form, in a process instance. The &lsquo;assignee&rsquo; can be a combination of users and groups. There are various ways a form can be assigned to a user:</p><p>​ a) Using <strong>Rules</strong>, in particular the Workflow rule <strong>Assign form</strong>, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form</a> for details</p><p>​ b) Using <strong>Quick actions</strong>, see <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/>Form Quick action</a> for details</p><p>​ c) Creating <strong>form owners</strong> when creating or updating a process design, see <a href=#creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</a> for details</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Only form owners</strong> can edit a given form when it is a <strong>current form</strong> in a process flow by <strong>default</strong>. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.</p></li></ol><p>So what is <strong>form owner</strong>? A form owner is assigned when a form is created in Kianda <strong>Designer</strong>. Form owners can also be added to a form design at a later stage by editing the form. Only the form owner will be able to <strong>edit current forms</strong> in <strong>process instances</strong> (records), see below.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-form-owners>Getting started with Form owners</h2><h3 id=creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</h3><ol>
<li>Click on a process by going to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on an existing process or create a new process by clicking on <strong>Add new</strong> and complete the <strong>Add new process</strong> dialog box.</li><li>Then within Kianda <strong>Designer</strong> click on a form of interest and then click on the <strong>Edit/(Pen)</strong> <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Edit/Pen button"> button for that form.</li><li>In the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box you can add form owners in the <strong>Default owner(s)</strong> field.</li></ol><p><img src=/images/new-form-owners.jpg alt="Partner account details attributes"></p><p>​ Using the dropdown list choose from:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - Users must already be in the system, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/users/>Users & Groups</a></li><li><strong>Groups</strong> - Groups must be defined in advance, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/users/>Users & Groups</a></li><li><strong>Partners</strong> - Partners must be already in the system and active, see <a href=/docs/platform/administration/b2b-portals/>B2B portals</a></li></ul><ol start=4>
<li>If you make a mistake, or form owners need to be changed in an existing process, click on the <strong>x</strong> beside the name of the <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> or <strong>Partners</strong> to remove them and choose from the dropdown list again.</li><li>Add to or edit the remaining parameters in the dialog box as desired, see <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/designer/#editing-forms>Editing forms</a> and click on <strong>OK</strong> when complete, or <strong>Close</strong> to exit the dialog box at any time.</li></ol><h2 id=changing-form-access>Changing form access</h2><p>The <strong>default owner</strong> is the person or group that the form is assigned to using the <strong>default owner field</strong> in the <strong>new form</strong> dialog box as shown above. By default, only this person or group <strong>can edit the current form</strong> in a process instance. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The next section details how to <a href=#changing-default-owners>Change default owners</a>.</p><p>It is also possible to allow other users to have edit access to forms using the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign rule</a> and <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-quick-action/>Quick actions</a>.</p><h3 id=changing-default-owners>Changing default owners</h3><ol>
<li>
<p>Using your <strong>Administration</strong> or <strong>Design business process</strong> role, go to <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> > select a process > select a form in the process.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the form so the <strong>Edit/Pen</strong> button appears in the form name.</p><p><img src=/images/select-form-to-edit.jpg alt="Select form to edit"></p></li><li>
<p>Then click on the <strong>Edit/Pen</strong> button itself to edit the form.</p></li><li>
<p>An <strong>Edit form</strong> dialog box opens which has the same layout as the <strong>New form</strong> dialog box seen in <a href=#creating-form-owners>Creating form owners</a> above.</p><p><img src=/images/edit-form-dialog-box.jpg alt="Edit form dialog box"></p></li><li>
<p>Here you can change the default owner choosing from <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> and <strong>Partners</strong> as before.</p></li></ol><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To learn more about rules including <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign rule</a> go to <a href=/docs/platform/rules/>Rules</a>.</p><p>To find out how forms work within processes go to <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/process/>Process</a>.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always>

However, in a complex multi-step process, other forms can be configured to <strong>activate with</strong> the current form, meaning they can also become editable at the same time, creating a form group.</li></ul><p>These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below.</p><p><em><strong>New form dialog box</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/newformsegments-1.gif alt="New form dialog box"></p><p>These properties can also change <strong>dynamically</strong> as a result of <strong>rules being applied</strong>, see <a href=/docs/platform/rules/>Rules</a>.</p><h3 id=setting-display-modes-statically>Setting display modes statically</h3><p>Remember forms in process instances are either in <strong>edit mode</strong> meaning they can be edited/changed or <strong>read mode</strong> where the details are visible to form users but cannot be changed. The actions below refer to making forms <strong>editable</strong> so if the actions below are not used, then the forms are in <strong>read mode</strong>. The actions below refer to static or fixed use, set when the form is first created or updated at a later time.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Forms in process instances will be <strong>editable</strong> for <strong>Default owner(s)</strong>, that is the <strong>form owners</strong> defined when the form is created, or a form is edited. Form owners are defined in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, shown in part 1 of the image above. When a process instance runs, the form owner can then edit the form in that instance.</p></li><li>
<p>By default the <strong>first form</strong> in a process becomes the <strong>current form</strong>, so only this form will be <strong>editable</strong>. However if several forms are <strong>activated with</strong> the current form when the form is created or edited in the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box shown above, then <strong>all forms in that group</strong> will be editable by the form owner in a process instance.</p></li><li>
<p>By default the <strong>Submit mode</strong> for forms is <strong>Only this form</strong> meaning that when a process instance is running you can choose <u>only</u> that particular form can have details submitted or saved. Alternatively you can choose <strong>all forms in edit mode</strong>, meaning that several forms can have their details submitted or saved. For example if several forms are activated together and all are in <strong>edit mode</strong> then the details of all these forms can be submitted together in the database.</p></li><li>
<p>Forms can be statically set to allow <strong>Quick actions</strong> including allowing <strong>editing</strong>. When a form is created or edited using the <strong>New form/Edit form</strong> dialog box, clicking on <strong>Enable quick actions</strong> allows you to <strong>statically</strong> enable:</p><p>a) <strong>reassignment</strong> of forms</p><p>b) <strong>editing</strong> of forms</p><p>c) <strong>custom actions</strong> on any form</p><p>For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to <strong>hide form footer buttons</strong> when editing, and to <strong>trigger rules on save</strong> against a set field when saving edits.</p><p><img src=/images/enable-edit-action.jpg alt="Enable edit action"></p><p>For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the <strong>action display mode</strong> as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.</p></li></ol><h3 id=changing-form-display-dynamically-with-rules>Changing form display dynamically with rules</h3><p>If you use the <strong>Form action</strong> rule called <strong>Field display mode</strong>, you can change how a field or form displays <strong>dynamically</strong>. For example you have a condition set that the display will change based on the condition being present or not.</p><p>When you add this rule, under <strong>Action</strong> you can choose a field or form and choose from <strong>Edit mode</strong> or <strong>Read mode</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/field-display-rule.jpg alt="Field display rule"></p><p>For more information on this rule go to <a href=/docs/platform/rules/form-actions/field-display-mode/>Field Display mode rule</a>.</p><p>Other rules can be used in other ways to change process workflow and therefore how forms behave. For example using the <a href=/docs/platform/rules/workflow/assign-form/>Assign form rule</a> you can assign a form to a particular user, making them the form owner, and therefore giving them edit access to the form.</p><h3 id=whats-next--idea-iconimages18png>What&rsquo;s next <img src=/images/18.png alt="Idea icon"></h3><p>To read more about form ownership go to <a href=/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-owners/>Form owner</a>.

Forms are an important component of any process. They might be used as a stage of a process and can be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).</p><p>There are 3 key principles to consider when working with forms:</p><ol>
<li>Form <strong>design</strong> - what a form looks like, what elements it contains, for example controls and rules, see <a href=#designer-layout><strong>Designer layout</strong></a>.</li><li>Form <strong>interaction</strong>- how users can use forms depending on certain sequences happening, see <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/rules/><strong>Rules</strong></a>.</li><li>Form <strong>management</strong> - who can edit and access forms is set when creating a new form, see <a href=#new-forms><strong>New forms</strong></a>.</li></ol><h2 id=designer-layout>Designer layout</h2><p>To access processes, go to the left-hand pane and <strong>Administration</strong> > <strong>Designer</strong> and click on a process that you have created or imported, see <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/>Design and build your process</a>.</p><p>From the main process view, click on any process to add forms, for example Training process as seen below.</p><p><em><strong>Main process view</strong></em>

<h2 id=how-to-get-started>How to get started</h2><ol>
<li>
<p>How you get started with forms depends on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>if you have created a process using the App Store, see <a href=#predefined-forms>Predefined forms</a></p></li><li>
<p>if you have created a process from scratch or want to create a form from scratch, see <a href=#new-forms>New forms</a></p></li><li>
<p>if you import forms that have already been created, see <a href=#import-forms>Import forms</a></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p>Once your form is created, you are ready to start adding elements to your form, see <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/add-controls-and-rules/>Add controls and rules</a>.</p></li><li>
<p>In addition there are a number of settings you can change, see <a href=#settings-and-properties>Settings and Properties</a>.</p></li></ol><h3 id=predefined-forms>Predefined forms</h3><ol>
<li>
<p>If you have created a process using the <strong>App Store,</strong> then a number of forms will already be part of the process. For example the process Security Incident Management has 5 forms attached: Incident detail, Data breach, Malware outbreak, Root cause remedy and Caller review.</p></li><li>
<p>To edit form details, simply click on a form and click on the <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen icon"> to edit the form. You can also click on the <strong>Add form</strong> button to add a new form. Edit options are shown under <a href=#new-forms>New forms</a>.</p></li></ol><h3 id=new-forms>New forms</h3><ol>
<li>
<p>If you have created a process from scratch, an empty form is added to your process by default, called &ldquo;form 1&rdquo;. This is the first form. Click on this form and the <strong>Pen</strong> button <img src=/images/penicon.png alt="Pen icon"> to customise it. You can also click on the <strong>Add form</strong> button to add a new form.</p><p><em><strong>Adding a form</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/createnewform.png alt="Edit form"></p></li><li>
<p>There are a number of edit options below.</p><p><em><strong>Editing a form</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/editform.png alt="Edit form options"></p><p>Note: as you change any of the options in the dialog box, the impact will be shown in real-time on the form in the background, for example a title, or colour form theme.</p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - the form title, for example Employee Request Form</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Name</strong> - this is a unique name for the form</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Default owner(s)</strong> - by default the form creator is an owner. You can remove this owner by clicking on <img src=/images/x.png alt=x> and add other owners by clicking on the arrow and choose from <strong>Users</strong>, <strong>Groups</strong> or <strong>Partners</strong>.</p><ul>
<li>Users - allows you to choose individual owners</li><li>Groups - allows you to choose from defined groups for example HR Team or Management Team</li><li>Partners - allows you to choose predefined partner organisations that you want to share with or provide permissions</li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Activate with</strong> - will decide when the form will be active. If you have several forms attached to a process, then select from a dropdown list the form you want to activate with the current form. If you leave the field blank, the new form will be activated <strong>sequentially</strong> after the first form is submitted.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Submit mode</strong> - options are a) Only this form (the current form) or b) All forms in edit mode</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Form icon</strong> - click on the arrow to choose from hundreds of icons to attach to your form.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Form theme</strong> - choose from Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White Colours for your form.</p></li><li>
<p><strong>Enable quick actions</strong> - if you tick the checkbox, you can select from the options a) Enable re-assign b) Enable edit and c) Enable custom action. Click on <strong>Ellipsis</strong> button <img src=/images/ellipsis_frame.png alt="Ellipsis button"> to further modify the action settings.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If you click on <strong>Enable re-assign</strong>, you can reassign action settings to particular Users, Groups or Partners. Click on <strong>Allow form owners</strong> if you want form owners to be able to reassign actions.</p></li><li>
<p>If you click on <strong>Enable edit</strong>, you can allow certain Users, Groups or Partners to edit the form, along with form owners by clicking on <strong>Allow form owners</strong>.</p><p>Other options include a checkbox for <strong>When editing auto hide form footer buttons</strong> and <strong>Trigger rules on save</strong>.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If you check <strong>Trigger rules on save</strong> then click into the <strong>Save action field</strong> to choose from an action trigger as to when the form is saved, for example Submit, Save or Close. These can be other actions depending on what you have defined.</p><p><em><strong>Edit action settings</strong></em></p></li></ul><p><img src=/images/editactions.png alt="Edit action settings"></p></li><li>
<p>If you click on <strong>Enable custom action</strong>, you can allow certain Users, Groups or Partners to edit the form, along with form owners by clicking on <strong>Allow form owners</strong>.</p><p>Other options include <strong>Action label</strong>, <strong>Target action field</strong> and <strong>Action display mode</strong>, for example <strong>Read-only mode</strong>, <strong>Edit mode</strong> or <strong>Both</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Custom action settings</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/customactionsettings.png alt="Custom action settings"></p></li></ul></li></ol><p>As a form designer you can set up actions dependent on certain conditions, for example an Action label that targets a certain button appearing for example Close button, only when a certain display mode is chosen, for example Read-only mode. If <strong>Edit mode</strong> is chosen, then the button will only appear when the form is being <strong>edited</strong>. In this way you can create dynamic forms that suit user interactions.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the <strong>OK</strong> button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on <strong>Close</strong> to exit the dialog box without saving.</p></li><li>
<p>To save your changes to the form, click on the <strong>Save</strong> button <img src=/images/save.png alt="Save button">.</p></li><li>
<p>You are now ready to start adding <a href=/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/add-controls-and-rules/>Controls and rules</a> to your form. You can also implement additional settings see <a href=#process-settings>Process Settings</a>.</p></li></ol><h3 id=import-forms>Import forms</h3><ol>
<li>
<p>You can import a previously designed form by clicking on the <strong>Import</strong> button <img src=/images/importform.png alt="Import button">.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on the arrow to select from the drop down list to <strong>Select a process design</strong>.</p></li><li>
<p>Click on a <strong>process</strong> of interest and then click on the forms to import. Forms are indicated by a + symbol and can be expanded to show elements within a form for example a panel containing different fields such as lists and text boxes. This means you can import a whole form, or just elements of a form. In this way you can very quickly reuse some or all parts of an existing form.</p><p><em><strong>Importing from another process</strong></em></p><p><img src=/images/importfromprocess.png alt="Import from another process"></p></li><li>
