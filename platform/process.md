## Getting started with Kianda processes

The power of Kianda lies in giving anyone, even those without coding experience, the ability to design a **business application or process** quickly and efficiently, for example, this process could be a Quality Assurance checklist that installation engineers must follow on site using an app on their mobile phone or it could be a HR process to allow employees to submit annual leave requests and approve these online. Processes can connect to your data sources like Sharepoint or SalesForce allowing for the flexibility of your applications to grow as your business grows.

Each process comes with **dashboards** so you can see at a glance, for example, how many leave requests were submitted, approved and so on. And you can customise all of these processes the way you want.

Before you begin, we at Kianda recommend doing some simple planning before you design your process. It could be something as simple as a quick flow chart or a spreadsheet where you quickly log the key components, fields or rules that should be needed in the process. 



## Creating processes ##

1. To start creating your first process, go to the side menu on the left of the screen and click on  **Administration** > **Designer**. 

2. To create processes you can:

   - Use Kianda's pre-defined processes or Apps, see [Create processes using the App Store](#Create processes using the App Store)

   - Create your own processes from scratch, see [Create your own processes](#Create your own processes) 

   - Import processes that are already created, see [Importing processes](#Importing processes)

3. When you have created your process go to [Editing processes](#Editing processes) to find out more about your new process.

## Editing processes

1. When processes are created they are available to view and to edit.

   ![Process created](images/firstprocess2.png)

   You will note that information related to your processes are found in the main view panel, for example who created the process, and when. 

2. The first version of a process is **0.1** and will increment to 0.2 and so on, each time a process is updated. Once the process is **published** the version changes to **1.0** and increments with each publication. This makes it is easy to keep track of who and when changes were made and to restore an older version if needed. You can search for processes by typing your keywords into the search bar.

2. When you have created your process go to [Form Designer](platform/form_designer.md) to find out more on how to add and change forms within your process(es).

3. At any time you can edit the Title, Description, Group and Administrators of the process by clicking on the Pen button ![Pen icon](images/penicon.png).

4. At any time you can delete a process by clicking on the Bin/Trash button ![Bin icon](images/binicon.png) and then click on **Ok** after you have reviewed the process title and are sure this is what you want to delete. Click on **Cancel** if you wish to cancel the deletion.
