# Version history

The **current or active version** of a process is always visible in the right-hand pane, for example V0.2 for the process 'Quarterly Training Request' as shown below.

The **first version** of a process is **0.1** and will increment to 0.2 and so on, each time a process is saved. Once the process is **published** the version changes to **1.0** and increments with each publication. This makes it is easy to keep track of who and when changes were made and to restore an older version if needed.

## How to get started ##

1. To view the version history click on the **Design version history** button which may look like V0.1 or whatever is the current version for your process, for example ![View design version history](images/version.png) or ![Version 0.8](images/version8.png)

2. A pop-up shows the version history details including when the version was created and who created it. 

   In the example below, there are 8 versions of the process, all are **drafts** indicated by the 0 in front, such as 0.8.
