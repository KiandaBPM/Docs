   ## What to do next ##

   Remember there are 3 steps to producing business processes in Kianda:

   > 1. **Design** your process
   > 2. **Create** your process
   > 3. **Test** your process

   By importing an app, you've already done all 3 steps! However you might like to check out the design, edit a predefined process, and test the workflow. Click on the links above to go to the relevant sections.

   If you are inspired by these processes to **create your own process from scratch** go to [Design your process workflow](processdesign.md) to get started.

   In the next screen, you will see the forms within the process, in this example there are two forms: Customer Query and Agent Review. If you click on the form itself you can edit
