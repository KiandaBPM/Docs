# Design and build your process

Kianda processes are made up of **forms**. As we saw in [Plan your process](processplan.md), you may have a paper forms or email flows that you want to turn into a dynamic, digital process. 

To turn your process plan into a Kianda process, follow 3 simple steps:

> 1. [Create a process](#create-a-process)
> 2. [Create a form](formcreate.md)
> 3. [Add form elements](formelements.md)

To start creating a process, you need to reference your [process plan](processplan.md) and consider **what forms** you need and **who** will have access to these forms as an administrator. We will keep our Training Process [requirements](processplan.md#summary-of-requirements) in mind as we go.



## Create a process ##

1. To create a process, go to the side menu and click on **Administration** > **Designer**.

2. You are now in the main process view. From here you can click on **Import** or **Export** to import or export processes when created, or use the Kianda predefined processes in the **App Store.** 

   Click on the **Add new** button to create a process from scratch.

3. Fill out the details in the **Add new process** dialog box - that is **Title**, **ID** (a unique Name that autofills from the title), **Description**, **Group** (if you have a predefined group) and **Administrators**, people who will be able to administrate this process, choose from **Users** or **Groups**. Click on **OK** ![OK button](images/ok.png) when complete.
