[{"body":"After you have created a process, you are then ready to add forms. This is the second step in building a process.\nBuild process steps\nAs you work on your process, you can save drafts. This allows you make changes and restore to earlier versions if needed - see Version History for more information.\nBefore you begin  When adding forms, refer back to your process plan to determine what forms you need and who will have access to these forms as an administrator. As an example, we will keep our Training Process requirements in mind as we go.\nIn this Training Process example, we will create two forms: Training Request Form and a Training Approval Form.\nThe video below highlights how Kianda Designer works and How to get started runs through how to create forms for a sample Training Process.\nKianda Designer introduction\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   How to get started Once you have created a new process, you are automatically in Kianda Designer. This page allows you to: add and edit forms, add elements to those forms (like controls and rules), save, publish and preview forms, and view and edit form and field properties.\nKianda Designer has 3 key areas:\n Left-hand pane is used to add form elements like controls and rules. This pane also houses the Exit Designer Save Preview and Publish buttons. Central form canvas displays the current form you are working on. Right-hand pane is used to view and edit process, form and field properties.  Kianda Designer\nNote: By default, a first form, “form1”, is added to any new process you create. Click on the Edit form button (Pen icon ) to start editing this form to make it your own.\n Click on the Edit form button (Pen icon ) to edit ‘form1’. Complete the details in the Edit form dialog box - that is Title, Name, and Default owner(s) (people who will be able to administrate this form - choose from Users or Groups). There are other options like Form theme which are colours that you can apply to the form tab. These options are explained in further details in Designer. Changes made are visible in real-time in the form canvas. Edit a form  Click on OK button when complete. Click on the Add form button to add a second form. Repeat to add as many forms as needed.  Once you have added one or more forms to your process, you are ready to Add controls and rules to your forms! In our example we have two forms: Training Request and Training Approval. Save your work as you go by clicking on the Save button.  Save button in Kianda Designer\nWhat’s next  The next steps are:\n Add controls and rules Connect your data  User tips    You may have chosen to use predefined processes from the Kianda App Store. It is worth taking the time to check out how these processes are built to give you an initial idea of what is possible in Kianda.\nUse the Exit button to return to the main process view and then click on a process of choice to see details.\nYou can preview forms by clicking on the Preview button - see Previewer for more details.\nThere are many ways to then reuse elements within forms - for example, using the Group field and cloning. For more information, see the video Reusability of process and form components.\n  There are many ways to manage who has access to a process, or form - see the video How to control user security access to forms and process.\n  The key rules for working with forms are:\n Forms are assignable - means that only a form assignee can edit a particular form. This can be a combination of users and groups. Only form owners can edit a given form by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode. Multi-step processes use the concept of “current form”. Only the form matching the process status will be made editable. In a multi-step process, other forms that are not “current form” can be configured to activate with the current form, meaning they might also be editable and will form a form group.  These rules work together to determine if the form is in edit mode or display mode. Form designers have at their disposal business rules, such as assign form, go to form and submit rule, to dynamically control the ability of end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.\n  To return to the previous pages click on the links below   Plan your process Design and build your process  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"After you have created a process, you are then ready to add forms. …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/add-forms/","tags":"","title":"Add forms"},{"body":"This video introduces Kianda rules and demonstrates how to add a Send email Communications rule to a form.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

They include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields. Layout - There are four Layout fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields. Action - There are four Action fields that allow you to insert user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components. By default, three buttons are automatically added to each new form created - Submit, Save and Close.  A fourth category, Custom fields, exists if Kianda Developer has been used to create custom field widgets - see Developer for more details.\nAll fields will have edit options when you start creating the field, as well as field properties that you can edit.

They represent the actual actions users intend to perform when they interact with form components.\nCategories  Workflow - Enables you to execute actions that might change the flow of the information within a process. Communications - Enables sending emails or meeting requests or even user (push) notifications. Data - This is an important and flexible rule group because it allows you to configure CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) actions to configured data sources. Users - This enables you to retrieve a user property, updating user properties or lookup for a user based on a user attribute. File management - Allows operations such as the generation of a word document and conversion to PDF and more. Tables - Provides specialised rules to enable working with tables like sorting, copying table rows to another table and more. Dates - Enables convenient date calculation with advanced options like ignoring weekends or special dates. Form actions - Allows operations like submit, save, close and delete forms. SharePoint - Provides a variety of operations to be performed on the SharePoint connection. These rules include operations like create a list, find a user, define permission to an item, check-in / out an item or adding a user to a SharePoint group.  Working with rules Where to Add a rule  to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  How to Add a rule To add a rule to a specific component:\nSelect the field you want. Under Add a rule, select the rule you want. Edit the rule and click ‘OK’ - the rule will be displayed on the right-hand side of the page\nHow to Copy a rule Duplicating rules can be very useful in case you have similar rules that are in different fields. To duplicate a rule:\nSelect the field with the desired rule Click on the Clone rule button, next to the rule name Optionally, modify the rule settings\nHow to View a rule How to Edit a rule How to Disable a rule Where to place a rule in a list of rules Select the field with the rules. On the Rules section, drag and drop the rules in the order you want them. Submit, save, close If there is a Condition, then the fields must be set before it is run Example: Set Status, Send Email, Submit, Save, Close\nConditions Flexible and dynamic conditions form an important component to make forms fully dynamic. It enables you to create natural language conditions when rules should be triggered.\nTo configure a rule to conditionally execute an action:\nClick on Edit conditions button within the rule. Add the conditions that satisfy your scenario. Multiple conditions can be grouped with condition groups.\nCustom rules Under custom rules, you will find any custom-developed rules available under your developer section. Custom rules provide access to rules that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. This is particularly used in situations when existing rules do not provide the required functionality.\nCustom rules have the purpose of providing a user interface for the end-users. If you need to build “a rule” then you should use a custom rule widget.\nIt allows a developer to quickly build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes.\nCheck-out the development section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.\nWorkflow\nCommunications\nData\nUsers\nFile management\nTables\nDates\nForm actions\nSharepoint\nKianda_AI\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Business Process Rules Business rules are what makes Kianda forms come …","ref":"/docs/platform/rules/general/","tags":"","title":"General"},{"body":"Get started using Kianda to build business processes for your organisation Using this guide\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

This approach allows designers to build mobile-responsive applications via rapid User Interface (UI) prototyping. The UI provides an easy way to build an application by clicking, scrolling, and dragging and dropping fields. The layout both provides a way to build the application or process schema, and to capture and monitor data at run-time.\nWhat’s under the ‘hood’? The MVC approach enables user or system-supplied data captured through fields within forms, to react or trigger defined rules associated with fields, forms or processes, via the rules engine.\nThe rules-engine is made of:  Rule blocks - these are blocks that unlock specific functionality using a toolkit approach Flexible and declarative conditional logic  You can use these two key components - rule blocks and conditional logic - extensively and recursively to build the required orchestration of actions or rules that interact with data to provide the functionality you need in your apps or processes.\nThe rules engine, combined with conditional logic, enables designers to build ambitious, progressive web applications or end-to-end digital business processes that offer both a great UI and high performance.\nIn addition to the rules engine, CSS3, HTML5, EmberJS, WebApi and NodeJS are some of the underlying technologies used within the platform.\n What makes Kianda great is the simplicity and unbounded flexibility it gives citizen developers and low-code developers alike  In summary, the Kianda platform is an ideal interface for rapid prototyping and delivering outcomes quickly.\nUser tip  You can familiarise yourself with the key components of Kianda by going to the following links:\n Application designer Controls Rules Engine Dashboards system Connectors ecosystem  What’s next  If you want to use Kianda for no-code development, then follow these simple steps:\nPlan your process\nDesign and build your process\nPublish your process\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The Kianda no-code / low-code (NCLC) platform has been created with …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/welcome/how-kianda-works/","tags":"","title":"How does Kianda work"},{"body":"Input fields are one category of controls and include the most common data fields used to obtain user input - for example text boxes, lists and tables.\nGetting started with Input controls To start adding Input controls (fields) to your Kianda forms, you first need to either open an existing process or create a new process by going to Administration \u003e Designer in the left side menu. See Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.\nOnce you have opened your process, select the form you want to work on (so that the Edit Form button is shown) and then click on Controls in the left-hand pane so the Controls menu expands to show the four categories of Controls (fields): Input, Layout, Actions and Custom.\nSelect Input to view the eight types of Input fields:\nThe eight types of input fields are:\n Text box - A text box field is a section in your form where users can enter text, for example, an Address field. See Textbox control for more information. List - A list field lists information, for example from a SharePoint data source. This is particular useful for dropdown menus, when you want a user to fill out a form and choose an item from a list. See List control for more information. Number - A number field provides an input box that only allows numeric input, such as currencies or percentages. Date - A date field provides a date and time picker that allows users to input both date and time. File - A file field allows users to upload multiple files. Uploaded files are stored within the configured data structures or folders. Table - A table field creates a table for input in a form. This table can be filled by the user, or autofilled as part of a rule. User picker - A user picker field allows users to choose from a list of users. This can be a preconfigured group (like HR Managers) or a list of users - see User picker control for more information. Toggle - A toggle field can be used as a toggle or checkbox that allows users to turn on/off components of the form.  How to add, edit, move and delete Input fields To insert an Input field into your form, click on the field type you want to add from the Input menu. For example, to add a new text box field, click on Text box - a pop-up message will appear saying ‘Field added’ and a new text box with the default name Text box 1 will be added to your form.\nTo edit whatever type of input field you have added to your form, select the field (by either clicking on the field name or on the Drag handle button ) and then click on the Edit Field button (Pen icon) . This will open up the Edit Field dialog box where you can make various changes (such as changing the Title of the field) and where a variety of options will be available to you, depending on the type of Input field you are working with.\nTo move an input field, simply select the field’s Drag handle button and drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it within your form.\nTo delete an input field from your form, select the field (by either clicking on the field’s name or its Drag handle button ), click on the Bin/Trash button and then click on OK to confirm.\nYou can also view and edit an input field’s Field Properties by selecting the field - for more details, see Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next  We have briefly introduced each of the eight types of Input controls. Now let’s look at each of these types of input fields in more detail:\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Input fields are one category of controls and include the most common …","ref":"/docs/platform/controls/input/","tags":"","title":"Input controls"},{"body":"You may currently have paper forms or email flows that you want to formalise, digitise and, most importantly, link to dashboards to see at a glance how processes are running and where organisational improvements are needed.\nFor example, take the scenario of a Training Request process. The current process may require an employee to email their line manager to request to attend training. The line manager either approves or disapproves the request by returning an email or calling the employee. If the training request is approved, then the line manager emails the training manager stating that the employee will attend training and to schedule this.\nRather than continuing with email trails, with no easy way to see the status of each step and process overall, creating a solution in Kianda will save time, increase efficiencies and therefore reduce costs. In this way, you can become a citizen developer, a business professional who uses low-code/no-code tools to solve business needs.\nPlanning in an agile way Planning involves 3 considerations: Design , Interaction and Management. We will now look at each of these areas in turn.\nPlanning process\nTo plan a solution, you could use Microsoft Office Tools or another preferred program or method to chart out what you need. Each heading will guide through what you need to consider.\nIf you already have a process workflow mapped out, you can go straight to designing and building in Kianda.\nPlanning your design Design considers what a process needs to do and how it might look. Information can be gathered through various methods like Really Round Robin, hackathons and surveys, and captured in product vision boards. Using the 5W’s of who, what, when, where and why, along with how, can help map out the necessary information during the project initiation phase.\nIn particular, consider what forms you need in your process. What kinds of fields do you need in order to get the data you seek? What about information you need to provide to form users? Connecting to datasources like information in SharePoint, Salesforce or SAP will make your processes dynamic and always up to date.\nIn the example of the Training Request process we already discussed, we will need two forms: 1) Training Request form and 2) Training Approval form. The information that we need to capture in each form is listed here, with potential field types in brackets. The information that will be provided to users in each form, for example a SharePoint list for users to scroll through, is also listed.\n   1) Training Request Form        Information provided: Type of Training (a SharePoint list)     Information needed: Employee Name (textbox) Reason for the Request (textbox) Line Manager (user picker)       2) Training Approval Form       Information provided: Name, Reason, Type (group from Request form) Line Manager (signature)   Information needed: Decision (a Yes/No radio list) Feedback (text box)    As you begin to capture the requirements for the process you want to create, it may be useful to refer to the different types of fields available in Kianda - see Controls for more information on field types.\nPlanning interaction Interaction considers how users will use the process and what series of events might happen to create different desired outputs. Decide on the sequence of events and what rules can or need to be applied to create a trigger for the next event in the process.\nIn the Training Request process, we’ll introduce Submit buttons to trigger actions, and a Rule so that the form will appear differently based on different user inputs.\n   1) Training Request Form       Actions: Submit (button) allows Employees to submit a form. Save (button) to save a draft form.   Rule: Send email to a Line Manager when form is submitted.        2) Training Approval Form       Actions: Submit (button) allows Line Managers to submit an approval. Save (button) to save a draft.    The approval appears in a dashboard for the Training Manager.    Rule: If Yes is chosen from a radio list, then input signature.     If No is chosen, then hide the signature and show a Reason text box.     As you start to think about what rules you may need to trigger the sequence of events in your process, it may be useful to refer to the different types of rules available in Kianda - see Rules for more information.\nPlanning management Next, you need to consider who will have access to the information. When designing forms, you can enable elements within a form so that they appear as visible-only or editable.\nYou also need to consider who the form owners will be, that is, who will have editing access to the forms themselves. This information is needed when you create a process and add forms to it. At this point, you will need to decide what users, or groups will act as form and process administrators. Here, we have outlined the form owners and users for the two forms in our Training Request process example:\n   1) Training Request Form      Access: All Employees can access the form.   Owner: Only the Training Manager can edit the form template.       2) Training Approval Form      Access: Only Line Managers can access the form.   Owner: Only the Training Manager can edit the form template.    Summary of requirements Finally, we can summarise all the information we need in a spreadsheet. Field types or controls and rules will become more familiar as you work with Kianda. For now, use this example as a way to get to know what is possible in Kianda.\nExamples of Requirements for a Training Request and Approval Process\nWhat’s next  Now that you know what you need to consider when planning a process, you can go to design your process to learn how to get started in the Kianda Designer. You can use this template, populated for a sample Training Process, to help get you started: Requirements template \nIf you would like to learn more about citizen development, have a look at Kianda’s articles on the Project Management Institute (PMI) blog: https://www.projectmanagement.com/blog-post/69464/citizen-development-part-2--getting-started\nTo return to the previous pages click on the links below   What is low-code development What is no-code development Logging in to Kianda Create your first Kianda process Add forms Add controls and rules  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"You may currently have paper forms or email flows that you want to …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/","tags":"","title":"Plan your process"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/","tags":"","title":"Rule conditions"},{"body":"The Kianda platform is a modern low-code and no-code development platform providing anyone, including those without coding experience, the ability to digitise business processes and create beautiful, mobile-ready web applications.

This is the third step in building a process.\nBuild process steps\nAs you add elements to your form, you can save drafts. This allows you make changes and restore to earlier versions if needed, see Version History for more information.\nBefore you begin  To add elements to your form, you need to reference your process plan and consider what fields you need and any rules that need to be applied to these fields. We will keep our Training Process requirements in mind as we go.\nIn our example, in the Training Request Form we have six control fields to add: two text boxes, one user picker field, two buttons, one list field, and one rule to send an email.\nWe will start with:\n  adding controls or fields to our form, starting with an example of a text box\n  editing field properties\n  then add rules where we will show two examples\n  How to get started There are three categories of Controls, and 10 categories of Rules, see Controls and see Rules for a full listing of what is available.\nControls and rules are available from the left-hand pane in when you click into a process.\nControls and Rules in left-hand pane\nNote: By default there are 3 buttons automatically added to forms - Submit, Save and Close, see form canvas in the image above.\n To remove a button or other field, click on the item and then click on the Bin/Trash button then click on OK to confirm removal. To move a button, or other field, click on the Drag handle button . To start adding controls or rules to a form, click on a form of choice so the as the Edit Form button (Pen icon ) is visible.  Adding a first control text box The first field we are going to add in our example is a textbox field to accept user input.\n  Click on a form that you want to edit, for example by clicking on the Training Request Form, the Edit Form button (Pen icon ) is visible, meaning this form is in edit mode.\n  Click on Controls in the left-hand pane. Click on a particular category, for example Input and then click on a particular field type to add, for example Text box.\n  The field is added to the form. To edit the field, click on the field so the Edit field button (Pen icon ) is visible.\nEdit field\n  Fill out the details in the Edit field dialog box - that is Title, Name, and choose options further options like Mode to have users input a single line of text, multiple lines of text or rich text.\nEdit field dialog box\nThere are other options like Text style where you can choose to Capitalise or have lowercase text only. Click on OK button when complete.\n  Repeat the steps above to add another textbox, or other field. We can add another text box field called ‘Reason’ for our Request Form. We can also add a User Picker field.\n  Click on Controls \u003e Input \u003e User picker. Choose from the options in the New field - User picker dialog box. Click on OK button when complete.\nNew field - User picker dialog box\nThe user picker field will be used in this example, to allow the form user to pick from a list of users. This could be a pre-defined group, or individual users. The user picker field could also be connected to an external datasource like a list of line managers from SalesForce.\n  Edit field properties as necessary to control how fields appear, see the next section Field properties.\n  The video below highlights how to edit forms, and the section Field properties runs through the the editing process in steps.\nEditing forms\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Field properties In addition to editing options when you add a field, you can also change field properties to impact form design.\nKianda Designer introduction\nTo edit field properties:\n  Click on a field so the Edit field button (Pen icon ) is visible. Field properties are available in the right-hand pane.\nProperties in the right-hand pane\n  Tick checkboxes as appropriate, for example ticking Enabled means users can fill out the field. Layout is used to set the width of the field for both desktop and mobile layouts. In the example above, Required is checked which means that the particular textbox field ‘Employee Name’ is mandatory for users to fill out. This is denoted by asterix * beside the field name. Go to Properties to find out more about properties.\nBeing aware of these options will help you to customise your form and impact the way it works.\nYou are now ready to add rules to create smart, interactive forms.\n  Adding rules Rules allow actions based upon conditions resulting from user interaction with fields. This creates smart, dynamic forms that follow business logic, all without the need for coding.\nThe video below highlights how to get started with rules, and the section Using a Communication rule runs through an example of how to add a communications rule to a form.\nGetting started with rules\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Using a Communication rule Send email In our example we will add a rule to send an automated email to a Line manager to approve a request based on a user completing the Training Request form and clicking on Submit.\n  Click on the Submit button to edit the button.\n  Click on Rules in the right-hand pane. By default there are three rules already applied to the Submit button, to Submit, Save and Close the process when the Submit button is clicked.\nRules for the Submit button\n  To create an automated email rule, click on Add a rule \u003e Communications \u003e Send email in the right-hand pane.\nAdd Send email rule\n  In the Edit rule - Send email dialog box, fill out the Title, and decide who are the email users, that is who the email will be From, To, any CC or BCC that should be included. Click on the User button to add users to each field.\nSelecting a user field\nNote: If you leave the From field blank, then the email will arrive from “noreply” @kianda.com.\nFor user fields like To and CC, there are various options to choose from . When you click on the User button choose a selection mode to choose a user, for example User(s) defined in a user field will allow you to use a field from a form. When you click in the field below Select a user field drill down to the field you want, in this example Line Manager. This means when the user submits a form and chooses their Line Manager, an automated email will go to that Line Manager.\n  Fill out the Subject and Body text. You can use the Expression builder to add expressions to the body to personalise the email.\n  Click on the field Add field to expression to drill down to the field you want, in this example Employee Name.\nExpression builder\n    Click on Add to expression. Note: Make sure you position your cursor in the correct place in the body of the email before you Add field to expression so that the expression is added in the correct place.\n  Click on OK.\nExpression added to an email body\n  Other expressions can be added that use values or status of processes, for example to create a link to review a process, use the ProcessLink() expression. Click on Expression builder and Reference to get a list of 16 expressions you can use. Note: Click on the field under Add field to expression to clear the field so that you can add a reference.\nExpression references\nCopy and paste an Expression reference, for example ProcessLink() into the box under Expression. This will create a link to a process.\nUsing the ProcessLink() expression, text can be entered into the brackets to provide a clickable link in the email as follows:\nIn our example the email will contain a link, linked to this process, that the Line Manager can click on, so they can approve the request.\n    Use font and styling options in the body text to set the format of the email. Click on OK when complete.\n  The rule is created. Click on the rule in the right-hand pane and drag it to the top of the rule list, to change the order of execution so that the automated email is sent out first when a user clicks on ‘Submit’.\nChanging the order of rule execution\n  ​\tFor more information on other rules that can be applied, go to Rules for a full listing of what is available.\n Make sure to save your work as you go by clicking on the Save button.\n  Repeat the steps above to add another email rule to another field, or try other rule, for example a Workflow rule as shown below.\n  Adding a second Workflow rule called Hide and Disable In the Training Process example, there is a second form that is part of this process, called Training Approval. From our Training Process requirements the Approval form will have 7 fields, and 1 rule. The fields include a field group, a banner and a list and a Workflow added to a radio list called ‘Management decision’. The added Workflow rule is called Hide and Disable, so based on user input, if someone clicks ‘Yes’ for the ‘Management decision, then a Signature field is shown to sign off on the form, if ‘No’ is clicked then the Signature field is hidden and a text box called ‘Reason’ is shown.\n  Select a field in a form to apply the rule to, in this example a field called ‘Management Decision’ in a Training Approval field.\n  To use a Workflow rule, click on Add a rule \u003e Workflow \u003e Hide and Disable in the right-hand pane.\nAdd Hide and Disable rule\n  In the Edit rule - Hide or Disable dialog box, fill out the Title, in this example ‘Hide or Show’, then click on Edit conditions.\n  Click on Add a conditions group. First we need to a) create a condition, click into the first field and drill down to the field in the form you want to base an action on, in this example, ‘Management decision’, then click on the operator field, in this case we choose Equals and in the third value field type in one of the possible values for this field, in this example ‘Yes’. Then click on OK.\nNote: There are 13 possible operators to choose from: Equals, Not equals, Contains, Greater than, Greater or equal, Less than, Less or equal, Is blank, Not blank, Matches pattern, Does not match pattern, Is Visible, Is Enabled.\n  In the Edit rule dialog box, that the first part of the condition appears see blue text ‘Management Decision Equals Yes’. We then need to b) create an action for the condition. Click on the field under Action and drill down to a field within a form, in this example the Signature field in the form Training Approval. Then click on the arrow beside the action to choose, in this example Show.\nNote: there are 7 possible actions in this list: Hide, Show, Disable, Enable, Toggle visible, Toggle enable, Hide and clear.\n  Click on Add to add a second part to the action, in this example to hide the feedback field upon a Management Decision of ‘Yes’. Click on the first field and drill down to the field of interest, in this example ‘Feedback’ which we will then ‘Hide’.\n  Click on Add otherwise action, in this example to add the actions based on a ‘Management Decision’ of ‘No’.\n  Drill down to the fields of choice, and click on the actions to add the reverse of the first action group.\nClick on OK when complete. Make sure to save your work as you go by clicking on the Save button.  Depending on the fields you use, for example user picker or lists, you can connect to a datasource to ensure information used in forms is always up to date. Click on the link to find out how to add a datasource and use it in a form field, for example a list.\nWhat’s next  The next steps are:\n Connect your data Preview the design  User tips   Make sure that you change the field properties to make fields Required, Enabled and so on, to ensure that the form appears the way you want, see Properties to find out more about properties. For example unchecking Enabled makes the field visible but not possible to edit. By default there are 3 buttons with every form, Submit, Save and Close. To remove a button, simply click on it and then click on the Bin/Trash button or to add a new button of choice, go to Controls \u003e Actions \u003e Button see Controls for a full list of controls. There are additional form settings that can be used, available in the right-hand pane of Designer. Click on a form in the process, then click on the Settings button to set additional settings such as Enable process security. This value can be checked and a group selected, so that only these users can access the form. Groups are added from Side menu \u003e Administration \u003e Users, click on Create new group to add users to a group, for example HR Team. There are many ways to then reuse elements within forms, for example using the Group field and cloning, see the video Reusability of process and form components. There are many ways to manage who has access to a process, or form, see the video How to control user security access to forms and process.

The central area is where the current form canvas is displayed. The right panel is where the currently selected component properties and rules are displayed.  Form designer key components\nResponsive form layout Form fields are made to with a mobile-first approach giving you design once and deploy everywhere opportunity.\nBy using the Layout option under the property panel you will be able to simply define the layout of your fields or panels within a form. Clicking on the ^ quickly uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.\nThis allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows designing web interfaces with a mobile-first approach.\nForms \u0026 layout fields Kianda comes with several pre-defined field widgets. In case none of these satisfies your specific needs and if you have some level of development skills you can always create your custom field widget.\nAt the time of writing, the default fields fall into four main categories of fields:\n Input - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields. Layout - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields. Action - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components. Custom - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields available under your developer section.  Layout fields take an important role when building a modern user interface and allow you to achieve the pixel perfect layout you want.\nModel dialogs Model dialogs are a special form of layout fields. It allows a form designer to define an interface with the key intention of grabbing users attention to something important.\nTypically we use dialogs for things like requiring user confirmation or to let them make a final decision.\nHow to use a model dialog\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   On the example above, we use a modal dialog to display a simple warning to the user. The following are the steps:\n On the Layout components, select the Dialog. Click on the dialog component to insert other fields within it. You can add any field to your dialog, in this case, we are adding a Rich text. To preview how your dialog box will be displayed, you can use the Preview button, on the dialog component.  Forms Forms are an important component of any process, they might be used as stages of a process and could be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).\nThe key rules for working with forms are:\n Forms are assignable - means that only a form assignee can edit a particular form. This can be a combination of users and groups. Only form owners can edit a given form by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode. Multi-step processes use the concept of “current form”. Only the form matching the process status will be made editable. In a multi-step process, other forms that are not “current form” can be configured to activate with the current form. Meaning they might also be editable and will form a form group.  The rules above work together to determine if the form is in edit mode or display mode. Form designers have at their disposal business rules such as assign form, go to form and submit rule to dynamically control the ability for end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.\nHow to add new form\nYour browser does not support the video tag.    Click on Add form, on the top right side of the page. Give your form a title. The name is a unique identifier - you can leave it as it is. You can define an owner to the form. Activate with will decide when the form will be active - if you leave it blank, the new form will be activated sequentially after the first form is submitted. Select Submit mode - you can submit just the current form or all forms that are in edit mode. Check Enable quick actions if you want the form to be edited or re-assigned. Provide a user or group in the Quick action user (s) to whom you would like to permit to re-assign or edit the form.  Anonymous Forms Anonymous forms are a great way of allowing people outside of your organisation to interact with your processes.\nIt could be something as simple as a contact form or a feedback form but as we all know a contact form never ends with the contact submission. There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result back to the person that started the submission.\nWe have seen a few examples of how people use anonymous forms in Kianda. From simple feedback forms to GDPR data requests that hope between multi divisions before sending back a response to the requester with the level of information held by the organization.\nAnonymous forms can be embedded in iframes and safely displayed within other web-based applications.\nIn Kianda there are effectively 2 types of anonymous forms\n New process anonymous form Existing process anonymous form  New instance anonymous form URL To set up a globally available link for allowing external users to create a new instance, perform the following steps within the form designer:\n On the top right corner of the designer click on the settings button. Then click the option “Enable anonymous sharing of forms” to Yes. Click the button “New Link” to generate a new anonymous link.  Existing instance anonymous form URL To setup existing instance anonymous form one needs to use the anonymous form rule to generate a new anonymous link at the runtime that will point to an existing process record that can then be shared with external users.\nNote that for this to work steps 1 and 2 of New Instance Anonymous form is still required.\nThe following are some of the key options of the anonymous link rule:\n Form to share (any form within an existing process). Link expires settings: Number of uses, time-based or never expire. Message to display on submission.  Important: There can be only one active link of each type for a given process. Once a new anonymous link is created for a process it will automatically expire the previous of the same type if a link existed.\nInput fields Kianda forms usability is brought to life with the help of the various input fields available that are specifically adapted to work in mobile, tablet or desktop modes.\nFrom the textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table, Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be adjusted to work with a myriad of scenarios.\nKey properties of fields:\nEach field comes with its own set of settings like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input.\nThe following are some of the common settings of input fields:\n Title - Every field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user. Required - This Boolean property allows making a field mandatory or not. Visible - Displays the field in the form or not. Layout - Defines both desktop or mobile layout.  Cascading dropdown The List field provides the opportunity to define an unlimited level cascading dropdown hierarchy very easily.\nTo achieve that you might connect your list to a data source table or SharePoint list then use the list data source conditions options to filter its content based on a parent list.\nHow to create cascading dropdowns\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Input validation Validating input in forms is quick and easy. Simply enable the required flag of an input field and it will automatically prevent users from submitting it empty.\nThe required flag will conveniently be ignored in case the field is not visible, this will allow you to configure conditionally mandatory fields.\nAnother way of validating input is to use the validate input rule this allows greater flexibility in terms of when or what to validate.\nCloning In the form designer, almost any of the components can be cloned. This will increase your productivity considerably and will make creating multi-step processes a breeze.\nTo clone either a field a panel or even a form simple select the component then click the clone button in the properties panel in the right-hand side of the panel.\nIf cloning a field the cloning dialog will prompt for the destination of the new cloned field, once your choice is made, simply click ok.\nCloning a form\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Custom fields Custom fields section provides access to fields that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. It is particularly useful in those situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.\nCustom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. If you need to build “an action” then you should use a custom rule widget.\nIt allows a developer to build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes.\nCheck-out the development section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.\nAdvanced techniques Like the cascading dropdown discussed above, several other advanced scenarios can be easily configured in Kianda. Here is a short-list:\n Repeating section - A repeating section can be created by adding a panel to a table field. This table can be configured to include a single column made of the panel that itself will include the repeating fields of your repeating section. The capture of media - Kianda enables mobile users to directly capture pictures, video or audio just like a native application. Background save - By making use of PWA principles (Progressive Web Application) Kianda allows the ability to perform background operations. This is useful when, for example, a mobile user picks-up their phone to perform a quick action and places it back in his pocket. Operations will continue in the background allowing all data to be captured. Image annotation - Kianda allows for image annotation online or offline. Multi-column / row layout - Making multi-column responsive interfaces is quite easy. Simply add two panels into a form that only use half of the screen (6 columns) then add fields inside panels and you have multiple column layouts. Adding a panel using 12 columns gives you a row. Form tab colour and icon - Form tabs can be quickly customised to display their icons or tab colours, it is also possible to define custom colours for selected and completed form tabs. Hide form tab and left nav - This is self-explanatory, yes you can hide the default navigation elements.

This approach allows designers to build mobile-responsive applications via rapid User Interface (UI) prototyping. The UI provides an easy way to build an application by clicking, scrolling, and drag and drop of fields. The layout both provides a way to both build the application or process schema, and to capture and monitor data at run-time.\nWhat’s under the ‘hood’? The MVC approach enables user or system-supplied data captured through fields within forms, to react or trigger defined rules associated with fields, forms or processes, via the rules engine.\nThe rules-engine is made of:  Rule blocks - these are blocks that unlock specific functionality using a toolkit approach Flexible and declarative conditional logic  These two components (rule blocks and conditional logic) are used extensively and recursively by designers to build the required orchestration of actions or rules that interact with data to provide the required functionality for your apps or processes.\nThe rules engine, combined with conditional logic enables designers to build ambitious, progressive web applications or end-to-end digital business processes that offer both a great UI and high performance.\nIn addition to the rules engine, CSS3, HTML5, EmberJS, WebApi and NodeJS are some of the underlying technologies used within the platform.\n What makes Kianda great is the simplicity and unbounded flexibility it gives citizen developers and low-code developers alike when building enterprise digital solutions.

This means with Kianda you get a digital experience that is native-like while maintaining online web benefits.\n Access your digital workspace PWA by going to https://\u003cbusinessName\u003e.kianda.com\n There are several benefits of using a PWA app when comparing to a web app or even a native only app.\n Reliable - Apps keep working with or without network access. Even when your users are going through a tunnel or in a lift, changes are automatically queued offline and then synchronised when connectivity is restored. Fast - App loads quickly thanks to having the app installed locally, app resources are available offline. Engaging - When installing on your home screen with your brand icons users receive timely push notifications that help them stay engaged.  Installing your PWA on a mobile There are a few options to install your Kianda PWA workspace into mobile devices. The quickest is to let your users manually use the option “Add to home screen” in their mobile devices.\nAndroid Android users are automatically prompted to install the PWA when they navigate to your digital workspace URL. Then can quickly choose to install by clicking the install banner prompt.\nOptionally users can manually install it by following the steps:\n Navigate to https://\u003cbusinessName\u003e.kianda.com. Clickthen tap on “Add to Home screen”. On the confirm dialog tap “Add”.  iOS iOS users are not yet automatically prompted to install PWA’s but it is something that can also very quickly be done by iOS users.\n Navigate to https://\u003cbusinessName\u003e.kianda.com. Tap the action buttonthen tap “Add to Home screen”. On the “Add to Home Screen” tap “Add”.  Offline or online As we know in some cases, when there is no internet connection, websites are completely constrained to be shown appropriately. On the other hand, progressive web applications are regularly independent, enabling users to browse the app when not online, this increases engagement and availability greatly. With an offline mode, any information can be saved automatically during the last online access.\nEmphasize benefits to potential clients who are frequently operating in remote areas with no access to the internet.\nPerformance Progressive web apps are faster because of the way the underlying technology caches and serves text, stylesheets, images and other content on the websites. As a result user experience, consistency and conversion rate increase.\nProgressive web apps utilize service workers, which are JavaScript files that run independently from the main browser thread and efficiently control caching, this is how progressive web apps enhance better performance than traditional web apps.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Progressive web applications are the next great trend for the mobile …","ref":"/docs/low-code/pwa/","tags":"","title":"Progressive Web Application (PWA)"},{"body":"Business rules are what make Kianda forms come alive. They represent the actual actions users intend to perform when they interact with form components - for example, sending automated emails, revealing certain parts of a form based on user interactions and automatically generating Word and PDF documents from completed forms.\nThere are 60 predefined rules across 10 categories and they can be applied to fields (controls), forms, groups of forms or even to a whole process - see Rules list for more details.\nThere are two key principles to consider when working with rules:\n  Rule design - Consider the type of rule you are going to apply and what you are going to apply it to - for example, to a button, field or form. As part of your design considerations it is important to know what you can do with rules, in particular, the use of conditions and expressions.\n  Rule order - If there are several rules attached to an item like a button, then the order the rules are going to be executed in becomes important. You can change the rule execution order to suit your needs.\n  How to get started If you go to Side menu \u003e Administration \u003e Designer, click on a process or create a new process, and then select a form within the process so that the Edit form button (Pen icon ) appears. The predefined rules will can then be found in the left-hand pane under Add a rule.\nRule categories\nThere are 10 categories of rules available (see Rules list for the full list of names of the 60 predefined rules):\n Workflow - There are seven workflow rules that represent the actions a user intends to perform when they interact with form components. Communications - There are four communication rules associated with user communication - for example, sending an email or triggering a user alert. Data - There are five data rules associated with database operations like create, update and delete. Users - There are four user rules associated with user properties, allowing user lookup or to update a user. File management - There are seven file management rules concerned with generating documents such as Word, Excel or converting to PDF. Tables - There are 12 table rules associated with table operations such as updating, adding and removing table rows. Dates - There are four date rules to calculate time and format dates. Form actions - There are six form rules linked to actions that are part of forms - for example, submit, close or save. SharePoint - There are 10 SharePoint associated rules such as adding, finding or removing users. KiandaAI - there is one KiandaAI rule related to text analysis.  An additional Custom category exists if Kianda Developer has been used to create custom rule widgets - see Developer for more details.\nWhen to use rules You can add rules:\n to a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load)  Rule design   Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form or field you want to apply the rule to by clicking on that item so that you’re viewing it in edit mode (so the Pen icon appears) - for example, you could select a form called Training Approval or could select a button like Submit to apply a rule or rules to.\nField editing\n  Click on Add a rule in the left-hand pane and select the category of rule you want, such as Communications, and then click the particular rule you want to insert within that category, for example User alert.\n  Rule order If there is more than one rule for an item like a field or button, then you need to consider the order of execution.\nFor example, for a Submit button on a form you may want a Send email rule to be executed first before any other rule is executed. To do this, click on the Submit button to make sure you are in Edit mode, and under Rules in the right-hand pane, drag the Send email rule to the top of the list of rules by clicking on the rule and dragging it to the top.\nRule order\nRules list This table contains a full list of the available predefined rules.\nRules by category and title\nWhat’s next  To learn more about control fields, go to Controls.\nTo find out how to get the most out of rules, see Conditions and Expressions.\nTo return to the previous pages click on the links below   How Kianda works Plan your process Design and build your process Add forms Designer Properties Add controls and rules  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Business rules are what make Kianda forms come alive.

A no-code platform provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) so that citizen developers or non-IT business professionals can easily create and deploy digital solutions to meet business needs.\nRegardless of how the solution is created, the output must meet all the requirements of a modern web application - being accessible through all major browsers and platforms and responsive in design so that it can be used on a variety of devices.\nKianda form Designer provides an intuitive interface where both technical and non-technical users can quickly start building digital processes, forms and apps for use on any type of device.\nYou don’t need to know how to code to take advantage of Kianda’s key features to create modern web application design. These features include:\n Multibrowser and multidevice access to a platform which can be used online and offline. Intuitive Designer to create forms at a click, with options to clone and activate several forms together. Wide array of predefined fields to choose from. Responsive form layout. Vast selection of properties and settings to customise your design. Connection to external datasources to create up-to-date, scalable processes such as highly dynamic forms. For example, lists with cascading dropdown options. Ability to allow multimedia capture and image annotation through forms. Rules to make forms reactive and interactive. Anonymous forms so that processes can be shared externally. Dashboards to monitor processes in detail. Options to create custom fields, rules and dashboard widgets  Click on each of these links to find out more.\nMultibrowser and multidevice access Kianda is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) which means it can be used across a range of up-to-date browsers, on any platform - Windows, MacOS or Linux - and on any device. As a PWA, this means you can browse Kianda when not online, increasing engagement and availability.\nThis is particularly useful when operating in remote areas - for example, performing a maintenance check of a wind turbine or other equipment in the field, and capturing information in draft form for submission later on back at the office.\nIntuitive Designer Kianda form Designer provides an easy way to build forms and process components.\nThe key components of the form designer are:\n Left-hand pane is used to add form elements like controls and rules. This pane also houses the Exit Designer Save Preview and Publish buttons. Central form canvas displays the current form you are working on and show the changes you are making in real time. Right-hand pane is used to view and edit process, form and field properties and rules.  Kianda Designer\nFor more information, go to Designer and view the following video.\nHow Kianda Designer works\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Predefined fields Kianda comes with 16 predefined field widgets, see Controls for a full list. You can also use Kianda Developer to create custom fields if you have some development experience and none of the predefined field widgets satisfy your specific needs.\nThe default fields fall into four main categories:\n Input - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields. Layout - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields. Action - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components. Custom - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields developed using Kianda Developer.  For example, layout fields play an important role when building a modern user interface as they allow you to add Richtext and Dialog boxes. You can use these fields together to create a modal dialog, allowing you as the form designer to create an alert for a form user - for example, when requiring user confirmation or making a final decision or check.\nExample of fields in action - creating a modal dialog\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Responsive form layout Form fields are made to with a mobile-first approach, giving you design once and deploy everywhere opportunity.\nBy using the Layout option in the property panel, you will be able to simply define the layout of your fields or panels within a form. Clicking on the Collapse or expand button quickly uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.\nThis allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows you to design web interfaces with a mobile-first approach. You can see this layout in action in this video.\nEditing forms\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Properties and settings Kianda form usability is brought to life with the help of the various input fields that are specifically adapted to work in mobile, tablet or desktop modes.\nFor each type of input field - such as textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table - Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be adjusted through properties and settings to work with a myriad of scenarios.\nEach field comes with its own range of settings like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input.\nThese are some of the common properties of input fields:\n Title - Each field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user. Required - Using this checkbox makes a field mandatory for form users to fill in. Visible - Displays the field in the form if checked. Layout - Defines both desktop or mobile layout.  In addition to these common properties, each field also has its own range of settings. For example, a list can have data entered manually, via a form, or from an external data source such as SharePoint or Salesforce and that list can be displayed as a dropdown, radio, multiselect or checkbox list.\nConnecting to datasources By connecting Kianda forms to existing external datasources such as lists in SharePoint, Google Drive or SQL tables, your processes will always stay relevant, up-to-date and perform as your data grows, creating a scalable solution.\nThere are currently 19 different predefined data connectors that allow you to connect external data sources to Kianda processes, as outlined in this video.\nExample connecting to a SharePoint datasource\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   The example in the video shows how a list field that is connected to SharePoint information can be used in a form, so that as the list grows on SharePoint, the information in the Kianda process will update dynamically.\nThe list field, in conjunction with datasources, allows you to define an unlimited level cascading dropdown hierarchy very easily.\nCascading dropdown example Let’s say, for example, that you have SharePoint or Salesforce lists of customers in different countries and different cities. You can then use the list data source conditions options to filter content based on that parent list.\nThis video shows how cascading lists connected to data sources works in practice.\nHow to create cascading dropdowns\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Multimedia capture When creating forms, there are options to capture user input in a variety of ways - for example, by clicking on radio buttons, selecting options from dropdown lists, entering text, uploading files, capturing images, videos, QR codes and voice input. This video goes through some of the possiblities you have when building forms with Kianda.\nExamples of possibilities with Kianda forms\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Rules Rules are an important component of any process as they can be used to trigger automated actions, requiring minimal user management once created. There are 60 predefined rules in Kianda, covering areas such as workflow applications, communications and file management.\nThis video goes through an example of a rule that sends an automated email once a Submit button is clicked on a form.\nExamples of possibilities with Kianda forms\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Anonymous Forms Anonymous forms are a great way of allowing people outside of your organisation to interact with your processes - for example, simple feedback forms to GDPR data requests that hop between multi divisions before sending back a response to the requester with the level of information held by the organisation.\nEven with a simple contact form or feedback form, the process rarely ends when the form is submitted. There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result that goes back to the person who started the submission.\nAnonymous forms can be embedded in iframes and safely displayed within other web-based applications.\nDashboards Use Kianda’s predefined widgets to create charts in a dashboard page for your process. There are seven different widgets that allow you to visualise different aspects of your process, allowing you to zone in on key data you want to highlight.\nCreating a dashboard\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Creating custom fields The Custom fields section of Kianda, called Developer, provides access to fields that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. It is particularly useful in situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.\nCustom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. If you need to build “an action”, then you should use a custom rule widget.\nCustom fields allow developers to build a reusable component that can then be used by process designers in real processes.\nCheck-out the development section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.\nWhat’s next  To start your no-code development journey, follow these simple steps:\nPlan your process\nDesign and build your process\nPublish your process\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"No-Code development involves the creation of applications or business …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/welcome/no-code/","tags":"","title":"What is No-Code Development?"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/low-code/why-choose-lowcode/","tags":"","title":"Why choose low-code development?"},{"body":"Conditions are a key component of Kianda rules. They are the triggers that result in fully dynamic forms and add an important level of interactivity, creating pathways within a process based on user interaction.\nConditions work on the ‘if…then…else’ principle: ‘if’ the condition exists ’then’ an action happens, ’else’ another action happens. There are three parts to applying a condition to a rule (depending on the rule that is used):\n Create the condition(s) Create the action(s) that will be applied as a result of the first condition being in place Create the otherwise action(s) based on other conditions being in place  For example, let’s take a simple Training Request and Approval Process, whereby an employee fills out a request form, the details of which are sent to a manager for review in an approval form. In this approval form, the manager can either a) approve the request with a signature or b) not approve the request and provide feedback on why.\nTraining Process flowchart\nA condition is created based on the Manager Decision radio list:\n Condition: If the decision is ‘Yes’ Action: Then the Signature button appears Otherwise action: Else the decision is ‘No’ and the Feedback text box appears  One of the most commonly used rules that uses conditions is the Workflow rule Hide or Disable. This is used as an example in the video and in the Getting started section below.\nUsing conditions in rules: Example of Hide or disable\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Getting started with conditions Conditions are recognisable in Kianda from the Conditions button found in rules and dashboards.\nTo create a condition:\n Select a form or forms, field or fields and then, a rule, for example Hide or disable, as found in the left side menu \u003e Add a rule \u003e Workflow \u003e Hide or Disable. Click on Edit conditions. Click on Add a conditions group. In the Edit conditions dialog box, choose from the elements below, by drilling down to the form(s) or field(s) that you want to apply the rule to.  Condition elements\nIn the case of multiple conditions, you can use And or Or to create compound conditions.\nCompound conditions\nClick on OK. Create the actions and, where applicable, otherwise actions. The action will depend on the rule that is chosen. For example, for the Workflow rule, Hide or Disable, click on the field under Action and choose the form(s) or field(s) where you want an action applied.  Action elements for Hide and Disable\n Then click on the field for actions and choose one of seven possible actions to apply.\nThe actions within Hide or disable are:\na) Hide will hide a process element (forms or fields) from view\nb) Show will show the element\nc) Disable blocks a user from editing an element\nd) Enable allows a user to add a value to an element\ne) Toggle visible will toggle between showing an element or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to\nf) Toggle enable will toggle between allowing an element to be edited or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to\ng) Hide and clear will allow you to hide a process element and clear the details. For example, if a toggle button has this rule applied, with an otherwise action of show as actions on a textbox, then if one value is chosen on the toggle button, the user is allowed enter details into the textbox, otherwise the field is hidden and cleared of data so that no data can be retrieved; this may be useful for sensitive information like a social security number on a form.\n  Click on + Add to add more actions.\n  Click on Add otherwise action to add more actions based on other values for the condition.\n  The video demonstrates how a condition works within the Hide and Disable rule and highlights that multiple groups of conditions can be used to impact multiple actions to create highly sophisticated form interactions.\nUser tip  You can use rules to create actions without conditions too. In this case, the rule will simply execute - for example, when the form or field is clicked on.\nWhat’s next  To learn more about controls (fields) go to Controls.\nTo find out more about how expressions are used in rules go to Expressions.\nTo return to the previous pages click on the links below    Plan your process\n  Rules\n  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Conditions are a key component of Kianda rules.

This agile approach results in significantly faster development time which is cost effective and reduces risk.\nAgile development cycle\nThe main phases of an agile project are:\n Planning - this involves determining the scope of the project, namely what is it you want to achieve, what end-users will be supported and how. The outcome will be a list of requirements that can be adjusted as the process is developed. Design - this involves constructing one ore more draft processes. Previewing the draft is included in this phase and there may be several rounds of revisions. Launch - this phase includes piloting the process with a number of users, monitoring results, getting feedback and then releasing the process including all related documentation.  Mapping these phases to process creation in Kianda, results in three main steps: Plan \u003e Design \u003e Publish. Each step contains three substeps.\nCreating your Kianda processes in an agile way Three steps to create a process\nUsing Kianda allows you to leverage the agile development process to maximum effect:\n  Plan - our documentation will guide you when it’s time for you to capture your requirements.\nWhat forms and fields do you need in your process based on what you want to do?\nWhat rules can be applied to create smart, automated processes?\nWho needs access to the forms as a user and form owner?

Forms are an important component of any process. They might be used as a stage of a process and can be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).\nThere are 3 key principles to consider when working with forms:\n Form design - what a form looks like, what elements it contains, for example controls and rules, see Designer layout Form interaction- how users can use forms depending on certain sequences happening, see Rules Form management - who can edit and access forms is set when creating a new form, see New forms  Designer layout To access processes, go to the left-hand pane and Administration \u003e Designer and click on a process that you have created or imported, see Design and build your process.\nFrom the main process view, click on any process to add forms, for example Training process as seen below.\nMain process view The designer window opens and is made up of 3 main parts.\nKianda Designer\nThe key components of the designer are:\n Left-hand pane is used to add form elements like controls and rules. This pane also houses the Exit Designer Save Preview and Publish buttons. Central form canvas displays the current form you are working on. Right-hand pane is used to view and edit process, form and field properties.  Note the name of the process you are working on is shown in the top menu bar, for example Training Process.\nThe video below demonstrates how to get started using Kianda Designer, and go to How to get started to follow through on different ways to import forms or start from scratch.\nIntroduction to Kianda Designer\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   How to get started   How you get started with forms depends on:\n  if you have created a process using the App Store, see Predefined forms\n  if you have created a process from scratch or want to create a form from scratch, see New forms\n  if you import forms that have already been created, see Import forms\n    Once your form is created, you are ready to start adding elements to your form, see Add controls and rules.\n  In addition there are a number of settings you can change, see Settings and Properties.\n  Predefined forms   If you have created a process using the App Store, then a number of forms will already be part of the process. For example the process Security Incident Management has 5 forms attached: Incident detail, Data breach, Malware outbreak, Root cause remedy and Caller review.\n  To edit form details, simply click on a form and click on the Pen button to edit the form. You can also click on the Add form button to add a new form. Edit options are shown under New forms.\n  New forms   If you have created a process from scratch, an empty form is added to your process by default, called “form 1”. This is the first form. Click on this form and the Pen button to customise it. You can also click on the Add form button to add a new form.\nAdding a form\n  There are a number of edit options below.\nEditing a form\nNote: as you change any of the options in the dialog box, the impact will be shown in real-time on the form in the background, for example a title, or colour form theme.\n  Title - the form title, for example Employee Request Form\n  Name - this is a unique name for the form\n  Default owner(s) - by default the form creator is an owner. You can remove this owner by clicking on and add other owners by clicking on the arrow and choose from Users, Groups or Partners.\n Users - allows you to choose individual owners Groups - allows you to choose from defined groups for example HR Team or Management Team Partners - allows you to choose predefined partner organisations that you want to share with or provide permissions    Activate with - will decide when the form will be active. If you have several forms attached to a process, then select from a dropdown list the form you want to activate with the current form. If you leave the field blank, the new form will be activated sequentially after the first form is submitted.\n  Submit mode - options are a) Only this form (the current form) or b) All forms in edit mode\n  Form icon - click on the arrow to choose from hundreds of icons to attach to your form.\n  Form theme - choose from Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White Colours for your form.\n  Enable quick actions - if you tick the checkbox, you can select from the options a) Enable re-assign b) Enable edit and c) Enable custom action. Click on Ellipsis button to further modify the action settings.\n  If you click on Enable re-assign, you can reassign action settings to particular Users, Groups or Partners. Click on Allow form owners if you want form owners to be able to reassign actions.\n  If you click on Enable edit, you can allow certain Users, Groups or Partners to edit the form, along with form owners by clicking on Allow form owners.\nOther options include a checkbox for When editing auto hide form footer buttons and Trigger rules on save.\n  If you check Trigger rules on save then click into the Save action field to choose from an action trigger as to when the form is saved, for example Submit, Save or Close. These can be other actions depending on what you have defined.\nEdit action settings\n    If you click on Enable custom action, you can allow certain Users, Groups or Partners to edit the form, along with form owners by clicking on Allow form owners.\nOther options include Action label, Target action field and Action display mode, for example Read-only mode, Edit mode or Both.\nCustom action settings\n    As a form designer you can set up actions dependent on certain conditions, for example an Action label that targets a certain button appearing for example Close button, only when a certain display mode is chosen, for example Read-only mode. If Edit mode is chosen, then the button will only appear when the form is being edited. In this way you can create dynamic forms that suit user interactions.\n  Click on the OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\n  To save your changes to the form, click on the Save button .\n  You are now ready to start adding Controls and rules to your form. You can also implement additional settings see Process Settings.\n  Import forms   You can import a previously designed form by clicking on the Import button .\n  Click on the arrow to select from the drop down list to Select a process design.\n  Click on a process of interest and then click on the forms to import. Forms are indicated by a + symbol and can be expanded to show elements within a form for example a panel containing different fields such as lists and text boxes. This means you can import a whole form, or just elements of a form. In this way you can very quickly reuse some or all parts of an existing form.\nImporting from another process\n  Click on the OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\n  Adding form elements If you have added a new form during the form creation process, then a blank canvas with 3 default buttons are available to you: Submit, Save and Close.\nDefault form buttons\n Go to Add controls and rules to find out more about adding form elements. Move elements by clicking on the Drag Handle beside the item and dragging it to where you want to place it. Edit elements by clicking on each item and clicking on the Pen button see Settings and properties  Settings and Properties In addition to the edits above, there are a number other actions and settings that you can implement to your process and forms.\nSettings and properties\nSettings are available from the right-hand pane and give you the ability to:\n  Import processes\n  View Version history\n  Change Process settings   Edit form information by selecting a form and clicking on the Pen button .\n  Change a field to another field by clicking on Change field\n  Create a duplicate form by selecting a form, clicking on the Clone button and then click on Ok.

The right panel is where the currently selected component properties and rules are displayed.  Form designer key components\nResponsive form layout Form fields are made to with a mobile-first approach giving you design once and deploy everywhere opportunity.\nBy using the Layout option under the property panel you will be able to simply define the layout of your fields or panels within a form. Clicking on the ^ quickly uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.\nThis allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows designing web interfaces with a mobile-first approach.\nForms \u0026 layout fields Kianda comes with several pre-defined field widgets. In case none of them satisfies your specific needs and if you have some level of development skills you can always create your custom field widget.\nAt the time of writing, the default fields fall into four main categories of fields:\n Input - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields. Layout - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields. Action - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components. Custom - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields available under your developer section.  Layout fields take an important role when building a modern user interface and allow you to achieve the pixel perfect layout you want.\nModel dialogs Model dialogs are a special form of layout fields. It allows a form designer to define an interface with the key intention of grabbing users attention to something important.\nTypically we use dialogs for things like requiring user confirmation or to let them make a final decision.\nHow to use a model dialog\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   On the example above, we use a modal dialog to display a simple warning to the user. The following are the steps:\n On the Layout components, select the Dialog. Click on the dialog component to insert other fields within it. You can add any field to your dialog, in this case, we are adding a Rich text. To preview how your dialog box will be displayed, you can use the Preview button, on the dialog component.  Forms Forms are an important component of any process, they might be used as stages of a process and could be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).\nThe key rules for working with forms are:\n Forms are assignable - means that only a form assignee can edit a particular form. This can be a combination of users and groups. Only form owners can edit a given form by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode. Multi-step processes use the concept of “current form”. Only the form matching the process status will be made editable. In a multi-step process, other forms that are not “current form” can be configured to activate with the current form. Meaning they might also be editable and will form a form group.  The rules above work together to determine if the form is in edit mode or display mode. Form designers have at their disposal business rules such as assign form, go to form and submit rule to dynamically control the ability for end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.\nHow to add new form\nYour browser does not support the video tag.    Click on Add form, on the top right side of the page. Give your form a title. The name is a unique identifier - you can leave it as it is. You can define an owner to the form. Activate with will decide when the form will be active - if you leave it blank, the new form will be activated sequentially after the first form is submitted. Select Submit mode - you can submit just the current form or all forms that are in edit mode. Check Enable quick actions if you want the form to be edited or re-assigned. Provide a user or group in the Quick action user (s) to whom you would like to permit to re-assign or edit the form.  Anonymous Forms Anonymous forms are a great way of allowing people outside of your organisation to interact with your processes.\nIt could be something as simple as a contact form or a feedback form but as we all know a contact form never ends with the contact submission. There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result back to the person that started the submission.\nWe have seen a few examples of how people use anonymous forms in Kianda. From simple feedback forms to GDPR data requests that hope between multi divisions before sending back a response to the requester with the level of information held by the organization.\nAnonymous forms can be embedded in iframes and safely displayed within other web-based applications.\nIn Kianda there are effectively 2 types of anonymous forms\n New process anonymous form Existing process anonymous form  New instance anonymous form URL To set up a globally available link for allowing external users to create a new instance, perform the following steps within the form designer:\n On the top right corner of the designer click on the settings button. Then click the option “Enable anonymous sharing of forms” to Yes. Click the button “New Link” to generate a new anonymous link.  Existing instance anonymous form URL To setup existing instance anonymous form one needs to use the anonymous form rule to generate a new anonymous link at the runtime that will point to an existing process record that can then be shared with external users.\nNote that for this to work steps 1 and 2 of New Instance Anonymous form is still required.\nThe following are some of the key options of the anonymous link rule:\n Form to share (any form within an existing process). Link expires settings: Number of uses, time-based or never expire. Message to display on submission.  Important: There can be only one active link of each type for a given process. Once a new anonymous link is created for a process it will automatically expire the previous of the same type if a link existed.\nInput fields Kianda forms usability is brought to life with the help of the various input fields available that are specifically adapted to work in mobile, tablet or desktop modes.\nFrom the textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table, Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be adjusted to work with a myriad of scenarios.\nKey properties of fields:\nEach field comes with its own set of settings like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input.\nThe following are some of the common settings of input fields:\n Title - Every field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user. Required - This Boolean property allows making a field mandatory or not. Visible - Displays the field in the form or not. Layout - Defines both desktop or mobile layout.  Cascading dropdown The List field provides the opportunity to define an unlimited level cascading dropdown hierarchy very easily.\nTo achieve that you might connect your list to a data source table or SharePoint list then use the list data source conditions options to filter its content based on a parent list.\nHow to create cascading dropdowns\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Input validation Validating input in forms is quick and easy. Simply enable the required flag of an input field and it will automatically prevent users from submitting it empty.\nThe required flag will conveniently be ignored in case the field is not visible, this will allow you to configure conditionally mandatory fields.\nAnother way of validating input is to use the validate input rule this allows greater flexibility in terms of when or what to validate.\nCloning In the form designer, almost any of the components can be cloned. This will increase your productivity considerably and will make creating multi-step processes a breeze.\nTo clone either a field a panel or even a form simple select the component then click the clone button in the properties panel in the right-hand side of the panel.\nIf cloning a field the cloning dialog will prompt for the destination of the new cloned field, once your choice is made, simply click ok.\nCloning a form\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Custom fields Custom fields section provides access to fields that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. It is particularly useful in those situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.\nCustom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. If you need to build “an action” then you should use a custom rule widget.\nIt allows a developer to build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes.\nCheck-out the development section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.\nAdvanced techniques Like the cascading dropdown discussed above, several other advanced scenarios can be easily configured in Kianda. Here is a short-list:\n Repeating section - A repeating section can be created by adding a panel to a table field. This table can be configured to include a single column made of the panel that itself will include the repeating fields of your repeating section. The capture of media - Kianda enables mobile users to directly capture pictures, video or audio just like a native application. Background save - By making use of PWA principles (Progressive Web Application) Kianda allows the ability to perform background operations. This is useful when, for example, a mobile user picks-up their phone to perform a quick action and places it back in his pocket. Operations will continue in the background allowing all data to be captured. Image annotation - Kianda allows for image annotation online or offline. Multi-column / row layout - Making multi-column responsive interfaces is quite easy. Simply add two panels into a form that only use half of the screen (6 columns) then add fields inside panels and you have multiple column layouts. Adding a panel using 12 columns gives you a row. Form tab colour and icon - Form tabs can be quickly customised to display their icons or tab colours, it is also possible to define custom colours for selected and completed form tabs. Hide form tab and left nav - This is self-explanatory, yes you can hide the default navigation elements.

Publishing involves three main steps: Deploying the process, Tracking dashboards and Launch.\nPublish process\nDeploy the process When you have tested your process prototype using the previewer then you are ready to publish your process to selected test users. It is prudent to have a limited deployment initially making the process available to stakeholders and testers to review. This limited group should include users with various levels of technical skill.\n  Before publishing, make sure you save your work. Go to the Side menu \u003e Administration \u003e Designer \u003e click on the process name.\n  Click on the Save button in the left-hand pane. Note that the Version of the process is available in the right-hand pane, where the current version is always visible.\n  Saving a process\n When you are ready to Publish, click on the Publish button.\n  Fill out the Publish process dialog box by adding comments. Choose from ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to bulk update process instances.\nPublishing a process\nIf you choose ‘No’ then the latest version is saved and published. If you choose ‘Yes’ then process instances will be updated with the latest design version. Two further questions are prompted:\n Trigger field rules after design update? Options are ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. If you choose ‘Yes’ then you can set a rule or rules to be executed after the design is updated, which will also update the existing instances of the process. Update all instances? Options are ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. If you choose ‘Yes’ this results in an update of the process and applies those changes to all existing instances of the process.    Click on OK when complete.\n  Once users have access to your process, it is useful to build one or more dashboards and monitor and track dashboards so you can monitor process data in real time and use this to further modify the process before full deployment.\nTrack dashboards Process dashboards provide real-time metrics to help guide decisions and make improvements in the organisation.\nThe video below introduces dashboards, and the steps in How to build a dashboard run through the the creating process in steps.\nDashboards Your browser does not support the video tag.  \nHow to build a dashboard   Go to the Side bar \u003e Home and then click on Create a new page button in the Quick Action menu.\nCreate new page button in the Quick Action menu\n  Fill out the Create dashboard page dialog box. Fill out the Title, the Name that is a Unique ID that autofills from the Title, decide on other parameters like groups that you would like to share to. Click on OK when complete.\nCreate dashboard page\n  The result is a menu of 7 widgets that you can add to your dashboard page. Go to Dashboards to find out more. For the moment we are going to add one widget, a list widget. Click on List widget.\nDashboard widgets\n  Fill out the Add widget dialog box. Choose a Title, layout size, colour scheme, and decide who the widget is visible to along with device visibility, that is when dashboards will be visible, for example during flight mode.\nAdd widget dialog box\nClick on OK when complete.\n  Configure or edit the widget by clicking on the Pen icon for the widget.\nEditing a widget\nNote: It it possible to add more widgets or edit/configure widgets when you are in Edit mode. To return to View mode, click on the Save button in the Quick Action menu. To return to Edit mode again, click on the Edit current page button in the Quick Action Menu.\n  There are a number of options to choose from in the Edit List dialog box. For now we are going to concentrate on two things: a) connecting to a business process b) choosing certain fields to view in our list.\n  Click on Business Process in the left-hand pane and select the process you want to link to, in this case Training Process.\nConnecting to a business process and fields\n  In the right-hand pane, click on Common fields and/or Design fields and select the fields that you want to show in your list widget, in this example the fields Employee Name, Type of Training and Management Decision are chosen from the Design fields. Click on OK when complete.\n    The result is a dashboard that shows instances of Training Requests submitted, and that status of each instance.\nList widget example\nIn this example if the entire process has been completed, the status is ‘Completed’ or if status says ‘Training Approval’ this means this form still needs to be completed. A dashboard like this can highlight bottlenecks in the organisation.\n  You can change the layout of the widget by clicking on the Settings (cog) button .\nFor example if you click on the bar for Layout columns you can increase the width of the widget and see the change in size in real-time in the background.\n  When you are happy with your changes, click on the Save button in the top menu bar.\n  When you are in view mode, you can kick off processes from the dashboard widget. Click on the Start new process button and select the process you want to use, in this example the Training Process.\nStart new process\nYou are then brought to the first form in the process, Training Request to kick off the Training Process. As forms are completed, the data in the dashboard is updated in real time.\n  There are endless possibilities with dashboards, the steps above are designed to highlight one particular scenario.\nExample of a dashboard page with different widgets\nConfigured dashboard pages can be shared with your selected users. Allow time for review and get feedback to incorporate into the iterative design process.\nWhen all feedback has been received, updates implemented, and a final quality review conducted successfully, then you are ready to launch!\nLaunch Launching your process involves making your process widely available, that is full deployment for the full user base. Ensure that you have communication, training and support resources in place as part of the launch to aid user adoption.\nIt is also important to make sure you document the development process so that this information can be used as a source of input for future updates.\nWhat’s next  If you would like to see examples of ‘how to’ perform particular tasks in Kianda, click on the link below:\n Short “how to” videos  To return to the previous pages click on the links below   What is low-code development What is no-code development Create your first Kianda process Connect your data Preview the design  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"When you have designed and built your process(es), you are ready to …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/publish-your-process/","tags":"","title":"Publish your process"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/security/record-security/","tags":"","title":"Instance or record level security"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/low-code/templating-basics/","tags":"","title":"Templating basics"},{"body":"Low-code development offers software developers a shortcut to create something new and beneficial for their organisation. Rather than having to think about every single line of code, as a developer you can take advantage of Kianda’s Developer section to create your own custom widgets from predefined field, rule and dashboard code.\nYou can also quickly use Kianda Developer to add webhooks, providing an efficient way to push GET requests to other applications in real-time as the Kianda process runs and avoiding the need to poll for data.\nKianda uses EmberJS to build widgets, and in particular the Handlebars templating library, to power the application’s user interface.

A custom widget could be a ‘Field’, ‘Rule’ or Dashboard widget’. This video goes through an example of how to create a custom field widget.\nCreating a custom field widget\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   To create custom widgets:\n  Go to the Side menu \u003e Administration \u003e Developer\n  Click on New widget.\n  Fill out the Edit widget dialog box - that is Title, Unique Id (which is autofilled from the title), Widget Icon, where you can select from hundreds of icons, and then Widget type. There are 3 options: Field, Rule or Dashboard widget - click on each link for more details.\n  Click on OK when complete.\n  Widgets created are visible in the main widget view. From here, you can edit a widget by clicking on the Edit button (Pen icon), delete a widget by clicking on the Bin/Trash button and restore earlier versions of a widget by clicking on the Version restore button .\nWidget view\n  Webhooks can be created to send a message to a specific URL by clicking on the Webhooks button.

ProcessLink() is a function that will return a link to that process instance. Using these expressions in an email will mean that every time an instance of the process runs, the values will be presented in an automated email, creating greater efficiencies and personalising the email for the recipient.\nOne of the most commonly used rules that uses expressions is the Communications rule, Send email - we will use this as an example in the video and in the Getting started section below.\nUsing expressions: Example of Sending email\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Getting started with expressions Expressions are recognisable in Kianda from the Expressions button found in edit rule dialog boxes and other menu items, such as enabling quick actions for processes.\nWithin rules, expressions can be created using the Expression builder where you can select Add field to an expression or use the handy Reference guide to get a list of commonly used functions.\nExpression builder\nNow let’s go step by step through the process of adding an expression to the Body of an email that is being sent using the Send email rule. To create an expression:\n Select a form or forms, field or fields and then, a rule, for example Send email, as found in the left side menu \u003e Add a rule \u003e Communications\u003e Send email. Under Action, click on the Expressions button beside Body. Click on the field under Add field to expression and find the field you want to reference in your email - for example, a text box titled EmployeeName. Click Add to expression. Click OK. To add additional field expressions, click on the Expressions button again, under Add field to expression, click on X beside the field name to clear the expression box and then search for the desired field from a form. To add a function, click on Reference and copy the function into the body of the email. A list of expression functions are available here:  (+, -, /, *) operations - Perform basic math operations Sum(arg1, arg2, …) - Returns the sum of the provided arguments Date(arg1) - Converts the argument into a date DateAdd(dateArg, day, month, year, hour, min) - Adds time to a date. The arguments day, month, year, hour and min represent the number to add for each respective argument Status() - Returns the process status ProcessID() - Returns the process ID FormOwner(‘formName’) - Returns form owners for a given form FormCompleted(‘formName’) - Returns form completed date for a given form Pad(value, size, symbol) - Adds left padding to the value with the symbol provided QueryString(‘parameter’) - Returns the URL query parameter or empty string if undefined IsOnline() - Returns “yes” or “no” if the current has connectivity or not ProcessLink() - Returns the html link to the current process.

For example, let’s say you would like the ability to add a few numbers together, without needing to define a computed property everywhere you would like to do so.\nHelper exampleConditionals Statements like if and unless are implemented as built-in helpers. Helpers can be invoked three ways; inline invocation, nested invocation and block invocation.

A custom widget could be a ‘Field’ widget or a ‘Rule widget’. Below we have an introduction video on how to create a custom field widget and following to this video we explain with an example on how to build a custom widget.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   Field widget The two images below display the default code for ‘Widget UI’ and ‘Widget Code’.\nThe ‘Widget UI’ defines the HTML, handlers, expressions and more.\nThe ‘Widget Code’ defines the logics and functions.\nRule widget The two images below display the default code for ‘Widget UI’ and ‘Widget Code’.\nList widget custom fields The other widget types are:\n Rules Dashboards  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Kianda comes with several pre-defined field, rule and dashboard …","ref":"/docs/low-code/","tags":"","title":"What is Low-Code Development?"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/low-code/list-widget-template/","tags":"","title":"Low-code customisation options for the list widget"},{"body":"Business rules are what makes Kianda forms come alive. They represent the actual actions users intend to perform when they interact with form components. There are 59 rules you can apply to forms, see Rules list.\nThere are two key principles to consider when working with forms:\n  Rule design - what type of rule you are going to apply and where, for example to a button, field or form\n  Rule order - if there are several rules attached to an item like a button, then the order of execution is important and can be modified to suit your needs.\n  How to get started If you go to Administration \u003e Designer and click on a process or create a new process, the predefined rules are found in the left-hand pane under Add a rule.\nThere are 10 categories of rules:\n Workflow - rules that represent the actions a user intends to perform, when they interact with form components. There are 6 workflow rules, see Workflow for more information. Communications - rules associated with user communication for example sending an email or triggering a user alert. There are 4 communication rules, see Communications for more information. Data - rules associated with database operations like create, update and delete. There are 5 data rules, see Data for more information. Users - rules associated with user properties, allowing user lookup or update a user. There are 4 user rules, see Users for more information. File management - rules concerned with generating documents such as Word, Excel or converting to PDF. There are 7 file management rules, see File Management for more information. Tables - rules associated with table operations such as updating, adding and removing table rows. There are 12 table rules, see Tables for more information. Dates - date rules to calculate time and format dates. There are 4 date rules, see Dates for more information. Form actions - rules linked to actions that are part of forms, for example submit, close or save. There are 6 form rules, see Form actions for more information. SharePoint - SharePoint associated rules such as adding, finding or removing users. There are 10 SharePoint rules, see SharePoint for more information. KiandaAI - there is 1 KiandaAI rule related to text analysis, see KiandaAI for more information.  Rule design   Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Pen button, Pen button for example a form Training Approval or Submit button.\n  Click on Add a rule in the right-hand pane and click on a category of choice, such as Communications and then a rule User alert.\n  Rule order If there is more than 1 rule for an item like a field or button, then the order of execution must be considered.\nFor example for a Submit button on a form I may want my Send email rule to be executed first before any other rule is executed. To do this click on the Submit button to make sure you are in Edit mode, and under Rules in the right-hand pane, drag the Send email rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and dragging it to the top.\nRules list A full list of rules is available in the table below.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Business rules are what makes Kianda forms come alive.

We place security at the core of our offering.\nIn terms of security and quality, Kianda’s services and solutions are ISO27001:2013 certified and audited by external parties, so you can be confident that we follow best practice for our clients’ data and information security.\nThe Kianda Platform is a solution that is SaaS cloud-based, and allows for integration to multiple third-party IT systems or siloed data sources. For example, SharePoint Online Environment and Active Directory, SAP, SQL Server, O365 and Oracle.\nQuality Assurance  To ensure Kianda meets the highest quality assurance levels, we employ a number of methodologies, including:\n Kianda is ISO 27001 ISMS certified and audited by an external party every 6 months. Details can be accessed here: https://www.kianda.com/information-security. Kianda follows agile methodologies for managing product development and project deliveries. Team members are certified in Agile Project Management and Scrum Framework, ensuring we deliver best practice project documentation and product development cycles. Kianda’s Information Security Management System (ISMS) policy is designed to protect Kianda’s information assets as well our clients’ information from all threats (whether internal or external, deliberate or accidental), to provide a security approach that satisfies our clients, and to ensure a solid understanding of security requirements and risk management practices and effective communication of security to all Kianda employees, contractors, partners, clients and third parties. Kianda’s Information Security Policy ‘Security in Development and Support Processes’ covers Patch Management Processes, Technical Review of Operating System Changes Restrictions on Changes to Software Packages and Product Development stages. Kianda regularly backs-up adequate copies and generations of all software, documentation and business information. Regular testing is carried out to ensure the quality and usability of backed-up resources.  The Kianda Platform fully complies with General Data Protection Requirements (GDPR) and is being continually improved, with an enhancement roadmap in place.\nSecurity and Authentication The Kianda platform provides Single Sign On (SSO) capability with SharePoint or OneLogin. This allows users to create, view and approve forms by first logging in with their Active Directory (AD) account.\nSecurity is provided by integration with the Clients Active Directory / O365 or other Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requirements. It can synchronise users and their groups from SharePoint, O365 or AD. The platform provides the ability for external users to integrate with SSO and MFA authentication via guest users in O365.\nKianda can be linked with active directory groups set up by the client to control permissions. The system can synchronize with the existing permissions from AD.\nUser Management The Kianda platform allows for different users to have different security privileges, providing for easy administrative management of users and their access rights. Our platform allows the following user levels by default:\n User -can only access what is assigned to them. For example, forms and dashboards. Administrator - can access (view and edit) all Manage partners/customers - can only access what is required to manage customer portals Design business process - can only design business forms and workflows Manage data sources - can only manage data sources and connections Developer - can design new widgets within the platform  The platform allows for the creation of user groups and the ability to assign these user groups to processes or dashboards as needed. Dashboard levels or particular widgets can be configured to only be visible to certain users or groups of users and data source connections can be configured in the same way to ensure the highest access control levels.\nOur data classification system has been designed to support access to information based on the need to know, so that information will be protected from unauthorised disclosure, use, modification and deletion.\nThe Kianda platform ensures that data is never transmitted in clear text or stored in a database or file solution. The platform is hosted in MS Azure with enterprise-grade security. All data generated is encrypted at rest and in transit. Data records are also masked from a GDPR point of view. We employ Microsoft security products to automatically mask and classify personal data - which is scheduled weekly.\nOverall, Kianda Technologies follows ISO ISMS policies, GDPR best practices and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) guidelines for product development. Kianda Technologies will also adhere to Client security standards.\nEase of use The Kianda Platform offers administrative interfaces that are private and segregated from user interfaces.\nKianda forms, by default, provide edit and reassign functions that are only available to admin users or configurable roles within the system. These quick actions allow admin users to make changes to an existing form record when needed. Any changes made by any user are logged in the Audit History.\nIn terms of designing new forms or making changes to existing designs, admin users have the ability to preview their changes before publishing within the design interface. Changes only become visible to end-users after the process or form has been published. In addition, live and test environments are provided to enterprise clients, providing the ability to test in the test environment before publishing to live.\nFor further ease of use, error messages are configurable within the Kianda platform. They can be created freely when forms are being designed to ensure scenarios such as data validation or indicating the next course of action. This gives flexibility to form designers to define error messages as needed.\nIt is easy to learn how to optimally use the Kianda platform. Kianda training is delivered by technical experts and trainers with a deep understanding of the platform, ensuring that clients’ training experience is optimised. Projects are structured so that clients’ appointed staff are involved during the whole journey of project execution. This facilitates knowledge transfer and an “on-the-job” training approach and includes specific training sessions that are run before and after solution delivery.\nDashboards and reporting The Kianda platform allows admin users to personalise dashboards based on the unique needs of users or user groups based on hierarchy - for example, only project managers see their forms status and admin users may see the full picture.\nMultiple dashboards can be created and customised as required per project, per department or other configurations. Access to the dashboards can be set at a high level for the entire dashboard or certain links, lists or widgets in a dashboard and can be made accessible to certain user groups defined in the system.\nDashboard page\nExamples of some of our dashboard features include:\n Number of forms awaiting approval Number of completed forms per week/period/quarter Split dashboards by type or department Columns to cater for “requested by”, “date of request”, “pending approval from”, “approved by”, “rejected by” An alerts section to highlight approvals that have been pending past X number of days Designing layouts to group certain fields Charts, Lists, Links, Tiles and Rich Text are available dashboard widgets  The Kianda platform allows users to report on different forms within a SharePoint site (or other relevant data source), as well as for a particular form library. In addition, the platform allows reporting across multiple form libraries, SharePoint Sites, and SharePoint Site Collections. Our reporting capability goes way beyond reporting from SharePoint data, and allows combining of data from multiple data sources for reporting purposes.\nAudit history Kianda logs and makes available all security-related events within the Audit History of each record to administrative users. Also, system logs can be made available when required.\nBy default, all the forms and processes created in our platform come with detailed read-only Audit History. Audit logs are created for any modifications made to records automatically and are only available to configured roles to view. Our platform allows for the set-up of an “auditor role”, with read-only access, to allow an auditor to run reports and check audit logs.\nAdmin users can configure optional record level viewing logs. The recording of audit logs is automatic for any changes in the forms which gives detailed field-level auditing information.\nThe Kianda Platform integrates with SharePoint which provides IRM (Information Rights Management) features that enable the tagging of certain data or documents not to be printed or emailed and so on.\nSupport and security updates Within the Kianda platform, administrative users and general users can report any queries or issues using the support ticket menu option available. Our platform is updated with one major release per year and patch/security releases multiple times during the year (which includes security updates). These are communicated with clients in advance.\nWe provide multi-levels of data recovery. This includes data version history of records, recycle bin feature and ability to recover from a point in time, backups with a time window of every 10 minutes.\nOur platform supports 99% uptime. We provide 99% availability; availability is calculated with the exception of scheduled maintenance.\nOur services are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, excluding planned downtime. We expect planned downtime to be infrequent but will endeavour to provide customers with advance notice. If our systems fail, we treat this as a critical high priority event with an impact on our business continuity. We will do everything possible to solve the issue as soon as possible. Our web services use highly available services with geo-redundancy enabling a failover to another European region in the event of emergency.\nWhat’s next  If you want to use Kianda for no-code development, follow these simple steps:\nPlan your process\nDesign and build your process\nPublish your process\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Kianda is committed to delivering a best-in-class solution to our …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/welcome/security/","tags":"","title":"Security"},{"body":"In this section we will cover a variety of use cases in a generic manner to highlight best practice use cases of Kianda features and how they help solve specific requirements.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"In this section we will cover a variety of use cases in a generic …","ref":"/docs/examples/","tags":"","title":"Example Use Cases"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/low-code/global-css-file/","tags":"","title":"Global CSS file"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/platform/rules/tables/","tags":"","title":"Table rules"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/platform/rules/dates/","tags":"","title":"Date rules"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/low-code/global-javascript-file/","tags":"","title":"Global JavaScript file"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/security/","tags":"","title":"Platform security"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/low-code/field-widget/","tags":"","title":"Custom form control development"},{"body":"Rules within the form action rules allow to perform form specific actions such as saving a form / process, submiting a form, closing a form, deleting a process and validating form input.\nTo find out more about each action go to the pages below:\n  Close a form\n  Save a form\n  Submit a form\n  Validate input\n  Delete form / process\n  Field display mode\n  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Rules within the form action rules allow to perform form specific …","ref":"/docs/platform/rules/form-actions/","tags":"","title":"Form action rules"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/troubleshooting/","tags":"","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"body":"Artificial Intelligence powered text analysis performs sentiment analysis to text content\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Artificial Intelligence powered text analysis performs sentiment …","ref":"/docs/platform/rules/kianda-ai/","tags":"","title":"AI rules"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/low-code/rule-widget/","tags":"","title":"Custom rule widget development"},{"body":"These rules describe SharePoint specific functionality.

You can choose from ‘Now’, ‘Today’ (which inserts today’s date and a time of 00:00 midnight) or ‘Relative from now’ (you can insert the date you want to use, in terms of the number of days, hours and minutes from now.

Forms are an important component of any process. They might be used as a stage of a process and can be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).\nHow the designer works This video introduces Kianda Designer and demonstrates how to start creating a form and add fields.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.   There are 3 key principles to consider when working with forms:\n Form design - what a form looks like, what elements it contains, for example controls and rules Form interaction - how users can use forms depending on certain sequences happening Form management - who can edit and access forms  This page presents the information you need related to form design, that is what a form looks like, and what it contains. By default, form designers can edit forms, but they can also set how other people interact with forms, for example to make forms viewable as read-only. Go to Form management to find out more about how form ownership works, and Form interaction to find out how a complete process flow works once forms are designed and assigned. Read the steps below to find out more about Form design.\nDesigner layout To access processes, go to the left-hand pane and Administration \u003e Designer and click on a process that you have created or imported, see Getting started with Kianda processes.\nFrom the main process view, click on any process to add forms. The designer window opens and is made up of 3 main parts.\nThe key components of the designer are:\n  Left-hand pane contains both controls and rules that can be added to forms. Go to Controls and Rules to find out more. The left-hand pane also houses the Exit button to go back to the process list, the Save button to save your work, the Preview button to preview what you have created and the Publish button to publish your work.\nNote that clicking on Save saves a draft which is not available to users until you click on Publish.\n  The central area is where the current form canvas is displayed. The canvas also houses 3 buttons by default: Submit, Save and Close. Go to Adding form elements to find out more about editing these buttons and adding elements to the canvas.\n  The right-hand pane is where the properties and rules are displayed for the selected item, see Properties for more information. From this pane you can also Import forms, see the Version history for a process and set process Settings. Click on the links to find out more.\n  Note the name of the process you are working on is shown in the top menu bar, for example Quarterly Training Request.\nHow to get started   How you get started with forms depends on:\n  if you have created a process using the App Store, see Predefined forms\n  if you have created a process from scratch or want to create a form from scratch, see New forms\n  if you import forms that have already been created, see Import forms\n    Once your form is created, you are ready to start adding elements to your form, see Adding form elements.\n  In addition there are a number of settings you can change, see Settings and Properties.\n  Predefined forms   If you have created a process using the App Store, then a number of forms will already be part of the process. For example the process Security Incident Management has 5 forms attached: Incident detail, Data breach, Malware outbreak, Root cause remedy and Caller review. Click on Kianda Apps to find out more about other apps in the App Store.\n  To edit form details, simply click on a form and click on the Pen button to edit the form. You can also click on the Add form button to add a new form. Edit options are shown under New forms.\n  New forms How to add new form\nYour browser does not support the video tag.     If you have created a process from scratch, an empty form is added to your process by default, called “form 1”. This is the first form. Click on this form and the Pen button to customise it. You can also click on the Add form button to add a new form.\n  There are a number of edit options below.\nNote: as you change any of the options in the dialog box, the impact will be shown in real-time on the form in the background, for example a title, or colour form theme.\n  Title - the form title, for example Employee Request Form\n  Name - this is a unique name for the form\n  Default owner(s) - by default the form creator is an owner. You can remove this owner by clicking on and add other owners by clicking on the arrow and choose from Users, Groups or Partners.\n Users - allows you to choose individual owners Groups - allows you to choose from defined groups for example HR Team or Management Team Partners - allows you to choose predefined partner organisations that you want to share with or provide permissions    Activate with - will decide when the form will be active. If you have several forms attached to a process, then select from a dropdown list the form you want to activate with the current form. If you leave the field blank, the new form will be activated sequentially after the first form is submitted.\n  Submit mode - options are a) Only this form (the current form) or b) All forms in edit mode\n  Form icon - click on the arrow to choose from hundreds of icons to attach to your form.\n  Form theme - choose from Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White Colours for your form.\n  Enable quick actions - if you tick the checkbox, you can select from the options a) Enable re-assign b) Enable edit and c) Enable custom action. Click on Ellipsis button to further modify the action settings.\n  If you click on Enable re-assign, you can reassign action settings to particular Users, Groups or Partners. Click on Allow form owners if you want form owners to be able to reassign actions.\n  If you click on Enable edit, you can allow certain Users, Groups or Partners to edit the form, along with form owners by clicking on Allow form owners.\nOther options include a checkbox for When editing auto hide form footer buttons and Trigger rules on save.\n If you check Trigger rules on save then click into the Save action field to choose from an action trigger as to when the form is saved, for example Submit, Save or Close. These can be other actions depending on what you have defined.    If you click on Enable custom action, you can allow certain Users, Groups or Partners to edit the form, along with form owners by clicking on Allow form owners.\nOther options include Action label, Target action field and Action display mode, for example Read-only mode, Edit mode or Both.\n    As a form designer you can set up actions dependent on certain conditions, for example an Action label that targets a certain button appearing for example Close button, only when a certain display mode is chosen, for example Read-only mode. If Edit mode is chosen, then the button will only appear when the form is being edited. In this way you can create dynamic forms that suit user interactions.\n  Click on the OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\n  To save your changes to the form, click on the Save button .\n  You are now ready to start adding Controls and Rules to your form. You can also implement additional settings see Process Settings.\n  Import forms   You can import a previously designed form by clicking on the Import button .\n  Click on the arrow to select from the drop down list to Select a process design.\n  Click on a process of interest and then click on the forms to import. Forms are indicated by a + symbol and can be expanded to show elements within a form for example a panel containing different fields such as lists and text boxes. This means you can import a whole form, or just elements of a form. In this way you can very quickly reuse some or all parts of an existing form.\n  Click on the OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\n  Adding form elements If you have added a new form during the form creation process, then a blank canvas with 3 default buttons are available to you: Submit, Save and Close.\nYou can:\n Add elements to this canvas by clicking on Controls and Rules in the left-hand pane. Click on each link to find out more about the 16 Control fields and Move elements by clicking on the Drag Handle beside the item and dragging it to where you want to place it. Edit elements by clicking on each item and clicking on the Pen button for example if you click on the Close button there are a number of options to choose from when editing see Form buttons.  Settings and Properties In addition to the edits above, there are a number other actions and settings that you can implement to your process and forms.\nSettings are available from the right-hand pane and give you the ability to:\n  View Design version history\n  Change Process settings\n  Create a duplicate form by selecting a form, clicking on the Clone button and then click on Ok. A version called ‘Form Name Copy’ is created and available to edit on the canvas. The Clone button can also be used to clone form elements like controls or buttons.\n  Edit form information by selecting a form and clicking on the Pen button .\n  Delete a form by selecting a form, clicking on the Bin/Trash button and then click on Ok after you have reviewed the form title and you are sure this is what you want to delete. Click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion.\n  View and edit Form properties and rules\n  Edit form buttons by clicking on a button of choice and then Change field, see Form buttons.\n  Process settings You can edit process settings by clicking on the Settings button in the right-hand pane.\nChoose from the settings:\n  Process id settings - choose from a) Default or b) Custom and use a combination of [ProcessName]-[UniqueNumber]-[FieldName]\n  Enable process security - if you tick the checkbox, can allow certain Users, Groups or Partners to have certain privileges related to the radio button options to create, assign and view as shown below.\nThe default setting is Security users can create, assign to can update, everyone else can view.\n  On load rules execution mode - options are a) Always b) When in edit mode or c) When open new.

File upload fields can also be useful if you want a file to be generated from the information entered in a form or if you want a file to be sent as part of your process - see Rules for more information.\nFor example, in an Inspection process, you may want the user (an inspector) to be able to upload the details of their inspection as a PDF file or photos as they complete an Inspection Form; or you may want the Kianda system to generate a report based on the information in the Inspection Form and to email this as a PDF file to a supervisor.\nHow to get started   To add a File upload field to a form, first open the relevant process. Then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible).\n  Insert the File upload field by clicking on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu, then select Input to view the range of Input controls and click on File.

If you choose From form field, another option appears - File name field - and you click in the blank field to choose the file name field you want the file name to be:\n  File extension: You can set/limit the type of file(s) that can be uploaded by inserting a specific file type. For example, if you insert .pdf in the File extension box, when the user browses for the file to attach, the file type will automatically be set to .pdf. If you want to allow any type of file to be attached, leave this option blank.\n  Enable media capture: If you choose Yes, this enables the user to capture media to upload - on a mobile device, when the user clicks on the Upload button their camera/video recorder will open (depending on whether you’ve selected the file extension to be image or video).\n  Button text: By default, the File upload icon has the text Browse, but you can change this here.\n  Button icon: By default, the file upload icon is but you can change this by clicking the Button icon drop-down menu and choosing a different icon from the large range of icons available.\n  Enable background upload: Select this checkbox to enable files to be uploaded using a background operation.\n  Enable chunked upload: Select this checkbox to upload files using resumable chunks.

Processes can connect to your data sources like Sharepoint or SalesForce allowing for the flexibility of your applications to grow as your business grows.\nEach process can be linked to dashboards so you can see at a glance, for example, how many leave requests were submitted, purchase orders approved and so on. And you can customise all of these processes the way you want.\nBefore you begin, we at Kianda recommend doing some simple planning before you design your process. It could be something as simple as a quick flow chart or a spreadsheet where you quickly log the key components, fields or rules that should be needed in the process.\nCreating processes   To start creating your first process, go to the side menu on the left of the screen and click on Administration \u003e Designer.\n  To create processes you can:\n  Use Kianda’s pre-defined processes or Apps, see Using the App Store.\n  Create your own processes from scratch, see Creating your own processes.\n  Import processes that are already created, see Importing processes.\n    When you have created your process(es) go to Editing processes to find out how to start adding forms.\n  You can also export any processes for backup and reuse, see Exporting processes.\n  Using the App Store   You can choose from Kianda’s process templates by clicking on the App Store button .\n  Choose from General, IT, Customer Services, Finance, Travel, Quality and Accounting apps by clicking on the relevant button in the left-hand pane and then select an app from within that category, for example Customer Support Queries.\nClick on Kianda Apps to find out more about other apps in the App Store.\n  You can click on Read More to read about the app and click on Import Process App to import the process.\n  If the process is an existing process, you can choose to override the existing process by clicking Yes or if not, click No. Change the Title and Name of the process as needed, for example Customer Queries, and click on Next.\n  The system will report datasources being imported. Click on Next.\n  Select dashboards to be included by checking the checkbox beside dashboards you want to import. In each case you can decide to override the existing dashboards by clicking on Yes or if not No. Click on Next.\n  You will see a summary of what is about to be imported.

Note that if you click on the arrow on the button, you have options to create a Process, a Component or Create from datasource.\n  A Process is a complete set of forms that encapsulates a business process for example, Purchase Order Approval.\n  A Component is a part of a business process, and you can decide your approach and how you want to order and present forms.\n  Create from datasource refers to using a particular data source and elements within that datasource tree, for example if you choose Kianda pre-defined processes then when you select Kianda you can see all the processes that are already imported into your system as shown on the right in the image below.\nClick on the OK button when you are finished to save your work, or click on Close to exit the dialog box.\n    The following edit options are available:\n  Title - of the process, for example Annual Leave Approval\n  ID - this is a unique name for the field\n  Description - a description of the process\n  Group - a defined group of users for example HR Managers\n  Administrators - choose from a) Users or b) Groups\nThese are the users or groups who will act as administrators for the process, for example to edit or delete the process.

Once the process is published the version changes to 1.0 and increments with each publication. This makes it is easy to keep track of who made changes and when, and to restore an older version if needed. You can also search for processes by typing your keywords into the search bar.\n  At any time you can edit the Title, Description, Group and Administrators of the process by clicking on the Pen button beside your process of choice.\n  At any time you can delete a process by clicking on the Bin/Trash button and then click on Ok after you have reviewed the process title and you are sure that this is what you want to delete.
