[{"body":"After you have created a process, you are then ready to add forms. This is the second step in building a process.\nBuild process steps\nAs you work on your process, you can save drafts. This allows you make changes and restore to earlier versions if needed - see Version History for more information.\nBefore you begin When adding forms, refer back to your process plan to determine what forms you need and who will have access to these forms as an administrator. As an example, we will keep our Training Process requirements in mind as we go.\nIn this Training Process example, we will create two forms: Training Request Form and a Training Approval Form.\nThe video below highlights how Kianda Designer works and How to get started runs through how to create forms for a sample Training Process.\nKianda Designer introduction\nYour browser does not support the video tag. How to get started Once you have created a new process, you are automatically in Kianda Designer. This page allows you to: add and edit forms, add elements to those forms (like controls and rules), save, publish and preview forms, and view and edit form and field properties.\nKianda Designer has 3 key areas:\nLeft-hand pane is used to add form elements like controls and rules. This pane also houses the Exit Designer Save Preview and Publish buttons. Central form canvas displays the current form you are working on. Right-hand pane is used to view and edit process, form and field properties. Kianda Designer\nNote: By default, a first form, “form1”, is added to any new process you create. Click on the Edit form button (Pen icon ) to start editing this form to make it your own.\nClick on the Edit form button (Pen icon ) to edit ‘form1’. Complete the details in the Edit form dialog box - that is Title, Name, and Default owner(s) (people who will be able to administrate this form - choose from Users or Groups). There are other options like Form theme which are colours that you can apply to the form tab. These options are explained in further details in Designer. Changes made are visible in real-time in the form canvas. Edit a form Click on OK button when complete. Click on the Add form button to add a second form. Repeat to add as many forms as needed. Once you have added one or more forms to your process, you are ready to Add controls and rules to your forms! In our example we have two forms: Training Request and Training Approval. Save your work as you go by clicking on the Save button. Save button in Kianda Designer\nWhat’s next The next steps are:\nAdd controls and rules Connect your data User tips You may have chosen to use predefined processes from the Kianda App Store. It is worth taking the time to check out how these processes are built to give you an initial idea of what is possible in Kianda.\nUse the Exit button to return to the main process view and then click on a process of choice to see details.\nYou can preview forms by clicking on the Preview button - see Previewer for more details.\nThere are many ways to then reuse elements within forms - for example, using the Group field and cloning. For more information, see the video Reusability of process and form components.\nThere are many ways to manage who has access to a process, or form - see the video How to control user security access to forms and process.\nThe key rules for working with forms are:\nForms are assignable - means that only a form assignee can edit a particular form. This can be a combination of users and groups. Only form owners can edit a given form by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode. Multi-step processes use the concept of “current form”. Only the form matching the process status will be made editable. In a multi-step process, other forms that are not “current form” can be configured to activate with the current form, meaning they might also be editable and will form a form group. These rules work together to determine if the form is in edit mode or display mode. Form designers have at their disposal business rules, such as assign form, go to form and submit rule, to dynamically control the ability of end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.\nTo return to the previous pages click on the links below Plan your process Design and build your process ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"After you have created a process, you are then ready to add forms. …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/add-forms/","tags":"","title":"Add forms"},{"body":"This video introduces Kianda rules and demonstrates how to add a Send email Communications rule to a form.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

For example a Developer will only see Developer within Administration, while a person with a Design business process role will only see Designer within Administration. User roles are set by Administrator who will have access to the Users function within administration. If you have full administration access then you will see nine functions by default within administration. These are:\nDesigner - users with the Designer business process role and administrators can access this function to design business processes\nApp Store - administrators can access predefined process templates within the App Store, and use these templates to create business process.\nSubscription - administrators can update an organisation’s subscription details, including Single Sign On, workspace look and feel and regional settings.\nData sources - users with the Manage datasources role and administrators can access this function to connect a workspace to external data sources such as SAP, SharePoint and Oracle databases.\nScheduled tasks - administrators can access this function to schedule tasks which can be full processes or parts of a process, for example to execute a rule, and schedule these tasks for a desired period or on demand.\nRecycle bin - administrators can access deleted processes, tasks and process instances in the recycle bin.\nUsers - administrators can manage user accounts using this function for example setting roles, profile properties, creating and deleting groups.\nInvite partner - users with the Manage partners role and administrators can access this function to invite business partners to view processes.\nDeveloper - developers and administrators can access this function to create customised field, rule and dashboard widgets.\nWhat’s next We have briefly introduced each of the nine functions within Administration.

They are the triggers that result in fully dynamic forms. They enable you to enables you to create natural language conditions when rules should be triggered.\nThe Conditions button is found within all rules as well as dashboard widgets. Conditions can also be set when setting data source security levels for B2B portals.\nConditions add an important level of interactivity, creating dynamic pathways within a process. These pathways could result from user interaction or from other events that happen.\nConditions work on the ‘if…then’ principle: ‘if’ the condition exists ‘then’ an action happens, and where applicable, if the condition does not exist, then another action can happen. You can use these principles as steps to implementing conditions:\nCreate the condition(s) Create the action(s) that will be applied as a result of the first condition being in place. Where applicable, create the otherwise action(s) based on other conditions being in place. Create the condition To create conditions, first choose the process element you want the condition to apply to – such as a form, set of forms, a field/control or set of fields. Next, depending on whether the rule is applied to a text-based field or date-based field, choose from 13 text operators or 25 date operators (see image below). Then choose a value, this could be typed in text, number(s), date(s), form(s) or field(s). Condition elements\nIn the case of multiple conditions, you can use And or Or to create a group of compound conditions:\nThe result is a flexible process workflow that will result in desired actions based on any number of conditions.\nRule action(s) – example Hide or Disable rule To create actions and where applicable, otherwise actions, the action will depend on the rule that is chosen. All Kianda rules use a natural language structure to make it is easy to apply actions. For example, for the Workflow rule, Hide or Disable, you can choose forms and fields from your process and then apply seven possible actions (as shown below).\n*Action elements for Hide or Disable*\nThe actions within Hide or disable are:\nHide will hide a process element (forms or fields) from view. Show will show the element. Disable blocks a user from editing an element. Enable allows a user to add a value to an element. Toggle visible will toggle between showing an element or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to. Toggle enable will toggle between allowing an element to be edited or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to. Hide and clear will allow you to hide a process element and clear the details. For example, if a toggle button has this rule applied, with an otherwise action of show on a textbox, then if one value is chosen on the toggle button, the user is allowed enter details into the textbox. The otherwise action is that the field is hidden and cleared of data, so that no data can be retrieved. This might be useful, for example, when sensitive information is used, like a social security number on a form. Note: You can use rules to create actions without conditions too. In this case the rule will simply execute, for example when a form or field is clicked on.\nWhat’s next Depending on how the rule is applied, for example to a Submit button, the rule order is important to consider, see Multiple rules.\nTo find out more about rule implementation, go to the main Rules page and then click on the links to the different rule categories.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction Conditions are a key component of Kianda rules.

You can choose from ‘Now’, ‘Today’ (which inserts today’s date and a time of 00:00 midnight) or ‘Relative from now’ (you can insert the date you want to use, in terms of the number of days, hours and minutes from now). Always set date even if not empty - if you select this option, this means that the default date you’ve chosen to be automatically inserted when a user opens the form will be updated/changed each time the user goes into the form. In other words, the initial date that was inserted when the form was first opened will be replaced/updated when the user goes back into the form. If you want the date field to retain the initial date the user started to complete the form, do not tick this checkbox.

For example if an employee submits a performance review form, a line manager may wish to access that submitted process instance/record and edit the form, adding in comments and performance grades.\nThere are two key principles to keep in mind in terms of form access:\nForms are assignable - this means that only a form assignee, that is, someone that is assigned to a form, can edit a particular form in a process instance. The ‘assignee’ can be a combination of users and groups. There are various ways a form can be assigned to a user\n​\ta) Using Rules, in particular the Workflow rule Assign form, see Assign form for details\n​\tb) Using Quick actions, see Form Quick action for details\n​\tc) Creating form owners when creating or updating a process design, see Creating form owners for details\nOnly form owners can edit a given form by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.\nSo what is form owner? A form owner is assigned when a form is created in Kianda Designer or form owners can be added to a process design at a later stage. Only the form owner will be able to edit process instances (records).\nOnce a process has been designed and users can initiate new process instances or records from a dashboard page, then the only people who can edit process records are the form owners or someone who has had the record assigned to them. For example, a line manager who is a form owner may need to add additional information about work goals in an appraisal form that their employee has already filled out.\nGetting started with Form owners Creating form owners Click on a process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and click on an existing process or create a new process by clicking on Add new and complete the Add new process dialog box. Then within Kianda Designer click on a form of interest and then click on the Edit/(Pen) button for that form. In the New form/Edit form dialog box you can add form owners in the Default owner(s) field. ​\tUsing the dropdown list choose from:\nUsers - Users must already be in the system, see Users \u0026 Groups Groups - Groups must be defined in advance, see Users \u0026 Groups Partners - Partners must be already in the system and active, see B2B portals If you make a mistake, or form owners need to be changed in an existing process, click on the x beside the name of the Users, Groups or Partners to remove them and choose from the dropdown list again. Add to or edit the remaining parameters in the dialog box as desired, see Editing forms and click on OK when complete, or Close to exit the dialog box at any time. Form ownership and process instances The default owner is the person or group that the form is assigned to when the the form is created. By default, only this person or group can edit the form. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction When creating forms, it is important to consider form …","ref":"/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-owners/","tags":"","title":"Form owners"},{"body":"Rules are an important component of any process as they can be used to trigger automated actions, requiring minimal user management once created. There are 60 predefined rules in Kianda covering workflow applications, communications and file management to name a few.\nCategories of rules Workflow - Enables you to execute actions that might change the flow of the information within a process.\nCommunications - Enables sending emails or meeting requests or even user (push) notifications.\nData - This is an important and flexible rule group because it allows you to configure CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) actions to configured data sources.\nUsers - This enables you to retrieve a user property, updating user properties or lookup for a user based on a user attribute.\nFile management - Allows operations such as the generation of a word document and conversion to PDF and more.\nTables - Provides specialised rules to enable working with tables like sorting, copying table rows to another table and more.\nDates - Enables convenient date calculation with advanced options like ignoring weekends or special dates.\nForm actions - Allows operations like submit, save, close and delete forms.\nSharePoint - Provides a variety of operations to be performed on the SharePoint connection. These rules include operations like create a list, find a user, define permission to an item, check-in / out an item or adding a user to a SharePoint group.\nWorking with rules When to add a rule to a field\nto a form\nto a process (the rule will run on load)\nHow to view a rule To view existing rules:\nSelect the field that contains a rule, for example a button at the end of a form, or a field within a form which if it has rules attached will be indicated as having rules within the form, as shown in the example below.\nUnder Rules in the right-hand pane, click on the given rule name to view the rule details, for example a ‘Set form’ rule called ‘Set link’ as shown below.\nDetails of the rule are available in the Edit rule dialog box, How to add a rule To add a rule to a specific component:\nSelect the field you want.\nUnder Add a rule, select a category of rules, and then select the rule you want.\nEdit the rule dialog box and click ‘OK’. The rule will be displayed on the right-hand side of the page.\nHow to copy a rule Duplicating rules can be very useful where you have similar rules that are associated with different fields. To duplicate a rule:\nSelect the field with the desired rule.\nUnder Rules in the right-hand pane, click on the Duplicate rule button next to the rule name.\nChoose Copy to another field if you wish to copy to another field and select the field you want to copy to. Select OK when complete.\nAlternatively select OK without copying to another field or click on Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\nHow to edit a rule Follow the steps to View an existing rule to open the Edit rule dialog box.\nIn the Edit rule dialog box, you can change:\nThe Title of the rule Create or edit conditions for the rule by clicking on the Edit conditions button. Change how the rule performs by changing details under Action. Actions will differ depending on the rule in use. How to disable a rule Disabiling a rule means that the rule is not active but is still visible in the Rules pane. The rule can be activated at any time again by clicking on the toggle button.\nSelect the field that contains a rule, for example a button at the end of a form, or a field within a form which if it has rules attached.\nUnder Rules in the right-hand pane, beside the given rule name slide the toggle button from ‘on’ to ‘off’ to view the rule details, for example a ‘Set form’ rule called ‘Set link’ as shown below.\nTo enable the rule at any time again follow the steps above and slide the toggle button into the ‘on’ position.\nWhere to place a rule in a list of rules The rule order refers to the order of execution of multiple rules. To change the rule order:\nSelect the field with the rules attached.\nUnder Rules in the right-hand pane, drag and drop the rules in the order you want them.\nThe top-most rule is the first rule to be executed. By default buttons at the end of a form will automatically have Submit, Save, and Close rules. If you create rules you may wish to have these rules placed above these shutdown rules so that your rules are executed first before form shutdown.\nNote: If there is a Condition, then the fields must be set before it is run For example an order of rules on a Submit button could be: Set Status, Send Email, Submit, Save, Close, whereby the status of the process instance is set first, before an automated email and then the form shutdown rules occur.\nTo read more about multiple rules, go to Multiple rules.\nConditions Flexible and dynamic conditions form an important component to make forms fully dynamic. It enables you to create natural language conditions when rules should be triggered.\nTo configure a rule to conditionally execute an action, follow the steps in How to view a rule to open the Edit rule dialog box:\nClick on Edit conditions button within the rule. Add the conditions that satisfy your scenario. Multiple conditions can be grouped with condition groups. For more information on Conditions, go to the Conditions page.\nCustom rules Under custom rules, you will find any custom-developed rules available under your developer section. Custom rules provide access to rules that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. This is particularly used in situations when existing rules do not provide the required functionality.\nCustom rules have the purpose of providing a user interface for the end-users. If you need to build “a rule” then you should use a custom rule widget.\nIt allows a developer to quickly build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes.\nCheck-out the development section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.\nWhat’s next We have briefly introduced the key concepts of rules.

This approach allows designers to build mobile-responsive applications via rapid User Interface (UI) prototyping. The UI provides an easy way to build an application by clicking, scrolling, and dragging and dropping fields. The layout both provides a way to build the application or process schema, and to capture and monitor data at run-time.\nWhat’s under the ‘hood’? The MVC approach enables user or system-supplied data captured through fields within forms, to react or trigger defined rules associated with fields, forms or processes, via the rules engine.\nThe rules-engine is made of: Rule blocks - these are blocks that unlock specific functionality using a toolkit approach Flexible and declarative conditional logic You can use these two key components - rule blocks and conditional logic - extensively and recursively to build the required orchestration of actions or rules that interact with data to provide the functionality you need in your apps or processes.\nThe rules engine, combined with conditional logic, enables designers to build ambitious, progressive web applications or end-to-end digital business processes that offer both a great UI and high performance.\nIn addition to the rules engine, CSS3, HTML5, EmberJS, WebApi and NodeJS are some of the underlying technologies used within the platform.\nWhat makes Kianda great is the simplicity and unbounded flexibility it gives citizen developers and low-code developers alike In summary, the Kianda platform is an ideal interface for rapid prototyping and delivering outcomes quickly.\nUser tip You can familiarise yourself with the key components of Kianda by going to the following links:\nApplication designer Controls Rules Engine Dashboards system Connectors ecosystem What’s next If you want to use Kianda for no-code development, then follow these simple steps:\nPlan your process\nDesign and build your process\nPublish your process\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The Kianda no-code / low-code (NCLC) platform has been created with …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/welcome/how-kianda-works/","tags":"","title":"How does Kianda work"},{"body":"Input fields are one category of controls and include the most common data fields used to obtain user input - for example text boxes, lists and tables.\nGetting started with Input controls To start adding Input controls (fields) to your Kianda forms:\nFirst, either open an existing process or create a new process by going to Administration \u003e Designer in the left side menu. See Create First Process to learn how to create your first process. Once you have opened your process, select the form you want to work on (so that the Edit Form button is shown). Click on Controls in the left-hand pane so the Controls menu expands to show the four categories of Controls (fields): Input, Layout, Actions and Custom. Select Input to view the eight types of Input fields: The eight types of input fields are:\nText box - A text box field is a section in your form where users can enter text, for example, an Address field. See Text box control for more information. List - A list field lists information, for example from a SharePoint data source. This is particularly useful for dropdown menus, when you want a user to fill out a form and choose an item from a list. See List control for more information. Number - A number field provides an input box that only allows numeric input, such as currencies or percentages. Date - A date field provides a date and time picker that allows users to input both date and time. File - A file field allows users to upload multiple files. Uploaded files are stored within the configured data structures or folders. Table - A table field creates a table for input in a form. This table can be filled by the user, or autofilled as part of a rule. User picker - A user picker field allows users to choose from a list of users. This can be a preconfigured group (like HR Managers) or a list of users - see User picker control for more information. Toggle - A toggle field can be used as a toggle or checkbox that allows users to turn on/off components of the form. How to add, edit, move and delete Input fields To insert an Input field into your form click on the field type you want to add from the Input menu.\nFor example, to add a new text box field, click on Text box - a pop-up message will appear saying ‘Field added’ and a new text box with the default name Text box 1 will be added to your form.\nTo edit whatever type of input field you have added to your form:\nSelect the field (by either clicking on the field name or on the Drag handle button ) Then click on the Edit Field button (Pen icon) . The Edit Field dialog box will automatically open, providing you with a variety of options for editing the field - such as changing the Title of the field - depending on the type of Input field you are working with. To move an Input field, simply\nSelect the field’s Drag handle button Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it within your form. This example shows how you could move a Text box field in a form: To delete an Input field from your form:\nSelect the field (by either clicking on the field’s name or its Drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button Click on OK to confirm. You can also view and edit an input field’s Field Properties by selecting the field - for more details, see Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next We have briefly introduced each of the eight types of Input controls. Now let’s look at each of these types of input fields in more detail:\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Input fields are one category of controls and include the most common …","ref":"/docs/platform/controls/input/","tags":"","title":"Input controls"},{"body":"You may currently have paper forms or email flows that you want to formalise, digitise and, most importantly, link to dashboards to see at a glance how processes are running and where organisational improvements are needed.\nFor example, take the scenario of a Training Request process. The current process may require an employee to email their line manager to request to attend training. The line manager either approves or disapproves the request by returning an email or calling the employee. If the training request is approved, then the line manager emails the training manager stating that the employee will attend training and to schedule this.\nRather than continuing with email trails, with no easy way to see the status of each step and process overall, creating a solution in Kianda will save time, increase efficiencies and therefore reduce costs. In this way, you can become a citizen developer, a business professional who uses low-code/no-code tools to solve business needs.\nPlanning in an agile way Planning involves 3 considerations: Design , Interaction and Management. We will now look at each of these areas in turn.\nPlanning process\nTo plan a solution, you could use Microsoft Office Tools or another preferred program or method to chart out what you need. Each heading will guide through what you need to consider.\nIf you already have a process workflow mapped out, you can go straight to designing and building in Kianda.\nPlanning your design Design considers what a process needs to do and how it might look. Information can be gathered through various methods like Really Round Robin, hackathons and surveys, and captured in product vision boards. Using the 5W’s of who, what, when, where and why, along with how, can help map out the necessary information during the project initiation phase.\nIn particular, consider what forms you need in your process. What kinds of fields do you need in order to get the data you seek? What about information you need to provide to form users? Connecting to datasources like information in SharePoint, Salesforce or SAP will make your processes dynamic and always up to date.\nIn the example of the Training Request process we already discussed, we will need two forms: 1) Training Request form and 2) Training Approval form. The information that we need to capture in each form is listed here, with potential field types in brackets. The information that will be provided to users in each form, for example a SharePoint list for users to scroll through, is also listed.\n1) Training Request Form Information provided: Type of Training (a SharePoint list) Information needed: Employee Name (textbox) Reason for the Request (textbox) Line Manager (user picker) 2) Training Approval Form Information provided: Name, Reason, Type (group from Request form) Line Manager (signature) Information needed: Decision (a Yes/No radio list) Feedback (text box) As you begin to capture the requirements for the process you want to create, it may be useful to refer to the different types of fields available in Kianda - see Controls for more information on field types.\nPlanning interaction Interaction considers how users will use the process and what series of events might happen to create different desired outputs. Decide on the sequence of events and what rules can or need to be applied to create a trigger for the next event in the process.\nIn the Training Request process, we’ll introduce Submit buttons to trigger actions, and a Rule so that the form will appear differently based on different user inputs.\n1) Training Request Form Actions: Submit (button) allows Employees to submit a form. Save (button) to save a draft form. Rule: Send email to a Line Manager when form is submitted. 2) Training Approval Form Actions: Submit (button) allows Line Managers to submit an approval. Save (button) to save a draft. The approval appears in a dashboard for the Training Manager. Rule: If Yes is chosen from a radio list, then input signature. If No is chosen, then hide the signature and show a Reason text box. As you start to think about what rules you may need to trigger the sequence of events in your process, it may be useful to refer to the different types of rules available in Kianda - see Rules for more information.\nPlanning management Next, you need to consider who will have access to the information. When designing forms, you can enable elements within a form so that they appear as visible-only or editable.\nYou also need to consider who the form owners will be, that is, who will have editing access to the forms themselves. This information is needed when you create a process and add forms to it. At this point, you will need to decide what users, or groups will act as form and process administrators. Here, we have outlined the form owners and users for the two forms in our Training Request process example:\n1) Training Request Form Access: All Employees can access the form. Owner: Only the Training Manager can edit the form template. 2) Training Approval Form Access: Only Line Managers can access the form. Owner: Only the Training Manager can edit the form template. Summary of requirements Finally, we can summarise all the information we need in a spreadsheet. Field types or controls and rules will become more familiar as you work with Kianda. For now, use this example as a way to get to know what is possible in Kianda.\nExamples of Requirements for a Training Request and Approval Process\nWhat’s next Now that you know what you need to consider when planning a process, you can go to design your process to learn how to get started in the Kianda Designer. You can use this template, populated for a sample Training Process, to help get you started: Requirements template If you would like to learn more about citizen development, have a look at Kianda’s articles on the Project Management Institute (PMI) blog: https://www.projectmanagement.com/blog-post/69464/citizen-development-part-2--getting-started\nTo return to the previous pages click on the links below What is low-code development What is no-code development Logging in to Kianda Create your first Kianda process Add forms Add controls and rules ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"You may currently have paper forms or email flows that you want to …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/","tags":"","title":"Plan your process"},{"body":"Introduction Kianda processes are made up of forms, which in turn contain fields or controls and rules. Fields are used to take in user input, make calculations, display values and so on, and rules are used to execute actions to drive the process.\nKianda Designer is used to create these forms and form elements within a process. Each process in Kianda Designer will have it’s own unique link or URL and this can be shared with other form designers for co-creation, for example, for a process named ‘Training process’ the link is:\nhttps://green-itr.kianda.com/admin/designer/training-process\nProcess instances When your process is created in Kianda Designer, you can save the process, and then submit data to that process. When you save or submit data, then an instance of the process is created. Another name for a process instance is a record. This instance is tied to user data or calculated values, or to whatever the process is designed to do.\nThe instance has a unique ID which can be seen in a list widget in a dashboard. For example, this List widget displays the individual records of various training requests submitted by employees. The unique ID for each record is shown in the first column. Form owners or those with security access can click on ID ‘new-training-process-39’ to view the training request form completed and submitted by employee Ryan B’Oul.\nList widget in a dashboard showing process instances\nThis means that each new record generated by a process will have its own unique URL that can be shared with those who have the required security access and need to be involved in that particular process instance. For example, in this case, the training request submitted by Ryan (an employee) may be viewed and approved by his line manager:\nhttps://green-itr.kianda.com/forms/new-training-process-39\nYou can create a link on your dashboard – in the example shown above, the Start new process button at the top right of the Training Requests list widget – that enables you to create a new record by bringing you into the relevant form. For information on creating list widgets go to List widget.\nIf you commit to the process by submitting or saving information, then the result is a new process instance – that is, a new unique record – which will be seen in a list widget in the dashboard, as seen in the image above.\nKeeping in mind that Designer is used to create processes, and that each ‘run’ of the process design results in a unique process instance or record, will help you later on when designing forms and dashboards. See Process settings for more details on process settings and parameters and Dashboards for more information on dashboards.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction Kianda processes are made up of forms, which in turn …","ref":"/docs/platform/application-designer/process/process-instance/","tags":"","title":"Process instance"},{"body":"Introduction A Shared Process is a process which you create within your own subscription with the intention to share with your B2B Portal. This process, as with all processes, can be used to review data, create new instances, update or delete instances.\nWithin a shared process, you can also create a Shared Dashboard which is a dashboard created within your own subscription with the intention to share with your B2B Portal. This dashboard, as with all dashboards, can be used to review data, access Shared Processes by creating new instances, updating or deleting instances.\nWhen to use Using the Shared Process feature will allow users within the B2B Portal to have access to a process you have created. By sharing this process you will give your partner the opportunity to work on the process by updating, creating and deleting instances.\nIt terms of dashboards, it is necessary to share your dashboard with your B2B Portal when sharing processes and dashboard widgets with your Client. Before you can share a dashboard you must first create one. This dashboard can be one that you have already created, however, we recommend creating a unique dashboard that will be used specifically for sharing with B2B Portals. Go to Dashboards to learn more about how to create dashboards.\nThe following sections will step through how to share a process (steps 1-3) and share a dashboard (step 4) and how to conclude and update partners (steps 5-6).\nHow to get started Log into your subscription and navigate to the Invite Partner section located within Administration. Your role needs to be Administrator or Manage partner to view Invite Partner. Using one of these roles:\nNavigate to Invite Partner within the Administration section.\nIn the Shared processes section, click on the Share a process button .\nThe Create a Shared Process dialog box opens.\nPopulate the fields as desired:\nTitle - provide a title for the shared process\nInstructions for partner - provide instructions for the selected partner\nClick on the plus symbol to add a selected process design to share. Then click on the dropdown list to search for a process to share.\nClick on the tick symbol to add the selected shared process. To change the selected shared process properties by clicking on the Cog/Settings button or delete the selected shared process by clicking on the Bin/trash button .\nIf you click on the **Cog/Settings **button a Process properties dialog box appears, as shown above, for example Training Request properties. You can check radio buttons for:\nAllow partner to create a new process instance - choose from Yes or No. If you choose Yes, then you are allowing invited partner(s) to create new process instances from the chosen shared process design.\nA field Partner user group allowed to create new instances appears, where you can define the group(s) in the partner organisation, that can create these new process instances. This is the first level of security for processes and dashboards. If you leave the field blank, then anyone in the partner organisation can create process instances.\nAllow partner delete a process instance - choose from Yes or No. If you choose Yes, then you are allowing invited partner(s) to delete new process instances from the chosen shared process design.\nPartner process form visibility mode - choose from Assigned or All forms. If you choose Assigned, then the invited partner(s) can view only assigned form versus all forms, if All forms is chosen.\nWhen you are finished editing the dialog box, click on OK, or else click on Close to exit the dialog box at any stage.\nIf you click on the Bin/trash button then a pop-up appears to Confirm removal, choose from OK or Cancel.\nClick on the Tick symbol to add further selected processes to share. Click on the Add partner group button to add one or more partner groups. Click on the Bin/trash button to delete partner groups. There are a set of dashboard parameters under the field Add partner group. These are:\nUnder Dashboard template click on the dropdown list to select an existing dashboards to share with the selected processes. If you choose to share a dashboard then you can select parameters: Dashboard name in partner - choose from Use your company name ‘Name of your organisation’ or Same as selected dashboard Make welcome page - choose from Yes or No. If you choose Yes then the selected dashboard becomes the welcome page for the partner if no other welcome page is configured. Dashboard security - choose from created partner groups within this field to ensure that only users in these partner groups can access the dashboard. This is the method to set security on the dashboard specifically. When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on OK, or else click on Close to exit the dialog box at any stage.\nOnce you have completed configuring or modifying the Shared Process you will need to send the shared process to your partner. To do this press the Send Update button which appears in the main view of the Shared processes section.\nWhat’s next Once you have successfully creating a shared process and dashboard, these will be available in the B2B Portal for partners, for example when your partner users log into the B2B Portal they will be able to see the newly shared dashboard. From here they will be able to see the widgets within the dashboard and interact with the Processes.

However, if you are a developer, you can use the platform to build ambitious web-based business applications of any kind.\nThe Kianda platform provides an ideal interface for rapid prototyping and delivering outcomes quickly. But don’t just take our word for it, see what our customers have to say. In this video, one of our customers outlines how Kianda has benefited their organisation due to it being user friendly and how the platform’s flexibility means their use of Kianda has expanded into more areas.\nWhat is possible with Kianda: DEME example\nYour browser does not support the video tag. The Kianda platform can quickly deliver amazing results to any digital project - from task automation to document generation - following industry best practices. So grab a cup of coffee and learn more about Kianda.\nKianda is a no-code and low-code development platform Kianda saves your organisation time and resources. Following a short onboarding, any employee can be assigned to build web applications for your business, without the need for any coding experience. No-code literally means just that - you don’t need to know how to code to create automated forms or build digital processes in Kianda. Anyone is empowered to create. Using Kianda, non-IT professionals can draw on their business expertise to rapidly and simply create a digital prototype in an easy-to-use interface and then share it with their colleagues.\nFor those who have coding experience, Kianda’s open, extensible architecture allows a low-code approach, meaning you can use the graphical user interface to extend the range of applications to create what you want, using your own code. This type of reusability, leveraging existing templates to build applications, reduces turnaround time and improves organisational productivity.

This rule has special meaning in terms of workflow allowing the application to direct user action and flow by hidding or showing entire sections of the application.\nMake required Use this rule to make individual fields required or entire forms. Unlike the field property ‘Required’, this rule will dynamically allocate a mandatory status on chosen forms or fields, for users to submit.\nGo to form Go to form rule navigates the user from the current form to the destination form. This rule could also set the destination form’s display mode.\nAssign form This rule enables dynamic form ownership and form security assigment of a form owner by assigning a user or a group to a form. You could also choose to override or append the form owner. By default only form owners can see the form in edit\nProcess security This rule defines the security of the entire process instance (record). Using this rule, you could add any user or group with the right permissions to view/update any instances.\nStart a (sub) process Start a process rule helps you create a new instance of the same process or a different process. You could also map the inputs from the current instance to a new instance.\nSchedule a rule This rule helps you schedule a rule/rules to be triggered one time, with a recurring schedule or immediately. For example, this rule could be used to schedule a daily reminder email to a user if the task is not complete.\nWhat’s next We have briefly introduced each of the six types of Workflow rules. Now let’s look at each of these types of rules in more detail:\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Workflow rules is one category of rules used to represent the actions …","ref":"/docs/platform/rules/workflow/","tags":"","title":"Workflow rules"},{"body":"There are a number of different ways of setting security within your Kianda workspace. Security refers to both access to processes as a Designer, and access to process instances.\nSecurity privileges by role The Kianda platform allows for different security privileges to be set for different types of users, making administration of users and their access rights easy to manage. The following are the different roles users can be assigned on Kianda – each has certain default permissions:\nUser – can only access what is assigned to them. For example, forms and dashboards. Administrator – can access (view and edit) all published processes. Can only edit draft processes that they have created themselves or for which they have been made Process Administrators. Manage partners/customers – can only access the essentials to manage customer portals; that is, they can use the Invite partners function under the Administration menu. Design business process – can only design business forms and workflows using Kianda Designer Manage data sources – can only manage data sources and connections, namely the Data sources function Developer – can design new widgets within the platform using the Developer function In addition to default permissions, you can also create user groups and assign ownership and/or access to processes or dashboards as needed. Security settings can be applied to dashboards or particular widgets within a dashboard so that they are only visible to certain users or groups of users; and data source connections can be configured in the same way to ensure the highest access control levels. We will now look at different ways of assigning access and controlling security.\nProcess administrators When an Administrator creates a new process in Kianda, they can set who they want the Process Administrators of that process to be (anyone chosen to be a Process Administrator needs to be someone who has an Administrator role, so that they have access to the Designer function to be able to edit the process). The Process Administrators can be individual users, groups or a combination of the two.\nIf you are an Administrator, you can edit a process you have created and set the Administrator role for that process by clicking on the Edit process button (Pen icon) in the main process view. Choose the user(s) and/or groups you want to be the Process Administrator(s) in the Edit process dialog box.\nSetting process administrators in the Edit process dialog box\nIn the example above, Vikky was already a Workspace Administrator who had access to the Designer function in Kianda – now that she has been assigned to be the Process Administrator for the Maintenance Process, this means that she can edit the draft process design.\nForm ownership When you create a process in Kianda, you can then set a default owner for each form you create within that process. Only Form Owners can edit individual process records. For example, if a ‘Maintenance Request Process’ is initiated from a dashboard, then the default Form Owner, regardless of their role (that is, regardless of whether their ‘role’ on Kianda is ‘administrator’ or ‘user’ etc), will be able to edit information submitted in new process records from that form.\nIf you are a Workspace Administrator and you’ve created a new process that contains a form, you can set the default owner for that form by opening the process in Kianda Designer, selecting the form and clicking the Edit form button (Pen icon). This opens the Edit form dialog box within which you can choose from individual users, groups or a combination of both under Default owner(s).\nQuick actions within forms Within the Edit form dialog box, you can select the Enable quick actions checkbox so that options to Enable re-assign, Enable edit and Enable custom action appear. From here, a Process Administrator or form designer can give individuals, groups or a combination of both, the ability to have process instances assigned to them, to enable them to edit in process records and custom actions of their choice.\nEdit form dialog box\nSelect the Enable quick actions checkbox, then select one or more of the checkboxes for the three options that appear below it (as shown in the image). For each of the options you select, click on the ellipsis button and select from Users, Groups and Partners, and/or check the box to Allow form owners the particular action – for example, re-assignment means the chosen users can click on the quick action button in the form and reassign the form to someone else.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about Workspace security, find out more about other security access levels:\nProcess level security Single Sign-On Data residency ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"There are a number of different ways of setting security within your …","ref":"/docs/security/workspace-security/","tags":"","title":"Workspace security"},{"body":"When you have created forms, then you are ready to add elements to those forms, that is controls and rules. This is the third step in building a process.\nBuild process steps\nAs you add elements to your form, you can save drafts. This allows you make changes and restore to earlier versions if needed, see Version History for more information.\nBefore you begin To add elements to your form, you need to reference your process plan and consider what fields you need and any rules that need to be applied to these fields. We will keep our Training Process requirements in mind as we go.\nIn our example, in the Training Request Form we have six control fields to add: two text boxes, one user picker field, two buttons, one list field, and one rule to send an email.\nWe will start with:\nadding controls or fields to our form, starting with an example of a text box\nediting field properties\nthen add rules where we will show two examples\nHow to get started There are three categories of Controls, and 10 categories of Rules, see Controls and see Rules for a full listing of what is available.\nControls and rules are available from the left-hand pane in when you click into a process.\nControls and Rules in left-hand pane\nNote: By default there are 3 buttons automatically added to forms - Submit, Save and Close, see form canvas in the image above.\nTo remove a button or other field, click on the item and then click on the Bin/Trash button then click on OK to confirm removal. To move a button, or other field, click on the Drag handle button . To start adding controls or rules to a form, click on a form of choice so the as the Edit Form button (Pen icon ) is visible. Adding a first control text box The first field we are going to add in our example is a textbox field to accept user input.\nClick on a form that you want to edit, for example by clicking on the Training Request Form, the Edit Form button (Pen icon ) is visible, meaning this form is in edit mode.\nClick on Controls in the left-hand pane. Click on a particular category, for example Input and then click on a particular field type to add, for example Text box.\nThe field is added to the form. To edit the field, click on the field so the Edit field button (Pen icon ) is visible.\nEdit field\nFill out the details in the Edit field dialog box - that is Title, Name, and choose options further options like Mode to have users input a single line of text, multiple lines of text or rich text.\nEdit field dialog box\nThere are other options like Text style where you can choose to Capitalise or have lowercase text only. Click on OK button when complete.\nRepeat the steps above to add another textbox, or other field. We can add another text box field called ‘Reason’ for our Request Form. We can also add a User Picker field.\nClick on Controls \u003e Input \u003e User picker. Choose from the options in the New field - User picker dialog box. Click on OK button when complete.\nNew field - User picker dialog box\nThe user picker field will be used in this example, to allow the form user to pick from a list of users. This could be a pre-defined group, or individual users. The user picker field could also be connected to an external datasource like a list of line managers from SalesForce.\nEdit field properties as necessary to control how fields appear, see the next section Field properties.\nThe video below highlights how to edit forms, and the section Field properties runs through the the editing process in steps.\nEditing forms\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Field properties In addition to editing options when you add a field, you can also change field properties to impact form design.\nKianda Designer introduction\nTo edit field properties:\nClick on a field so the Edit field button (Pen icon ) is visible. Field properties are available in the right-hand pane.\nProperties in the right-hand pane\nTick checkboxes as appropriate, for example ticking Enabled means users can fill out the field. Layout is used to set the width of the field for both desktop and mobile layouts. In the example above, Required is checked which means that the particular textbox field ‘Employee Name’ is mandatory for users to fill out. This is denoted by asterix * beside the field name. Go to Properties to find out more about properties.\nBeing aware of these options will help you to customise your form and impact the way it works.\nYou are now ready to add rules to create smart, interactive forms.\nAdding rules Rules allow actions based upon conditions resulting from user interaction with fields. This creates smart, dynamic forms that follow business logic, all without the need for coding.\nThe video below highlights how to get started with rules, and the section Using a Communication rule runs through an example of how to add a communications rule to a form.\nGetting started with rules\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Using a Communication rule Send email In our example we will add a rule to send an automated email to a Line manager to approve a request based on a user completing the Training Request form and clicking on Submit.\nClick on the Submit button to edit the button.\nClick on Rules in the right-hand pane. By default there are three rules already applied to the Submit button, to Submit, Save and Close the process when the Submit button is clicked.\nRules for the Submit button\nTo create an automated email rule, click on Add a rule \u003e Communications \u003e Send email in the right-hand pane.\nAdd Send email rule\nIn the Edit rule - Send email dialog box, fill out the Title, and decide who are the email users, that is who the email will be From, To, any CC or BCC that should be included. Click on the User button to add users to each field.\nSelecting a user field\nNote: If you leave the From field blank, then the email will arrive from “noreply” @kianda.com.\nFor user fields like To and CC, there are various options to choose from . When you click on the User button choose a selection mode to choose a user, for example User(s) defined in a user field will allow you to use a field from a form. When you click in the field below Select a user field drill down to the field you want, in this example Line Manager. This means when the user submits a form and chooses their Line Manager, an automated email will go to that Line Manager.\nFill out the Subject and Body text. You can use the Expression builder to add expressions to the body to personalise the email.\nClick on the field Add field to expression to drill down to the field you want, in this example Employee Name.\nExpression builder\nClick on Add to expression. Note: Make sure you position your cursor in the correct place in the body of the email before you Add field to expression so that the expression is added in the correct place.\nClick on OK.\nExpression added to an email body\nOther expressions can be added that use values or status of processes, for example to create a link to review a process, use the ProcessLink() expression. Click on Expression builder and Reference to get a list of 16 expressions you can use. Note: Click on the field under Add field to expression to clear the field so that you can add a reference.\nExpression references\nCopy and paste an Expression reference, for example ProcessLink() into the box under Expression. This will create a link to a process.\nUsing the ProcessLink() expression, text can be entered into the brackets to provide a clickable link in the email as follows:\nIn our example the email will contain a link, linked to this process, that the Line Manager can click on, so they can approve the request.\nUse font and styling options in the body text to set the format of the email. Click on OK when complete.\nThe rule is created. Click on the rule in the right-hand pane and drag it to the top of the rule list, to change the order of execution so that the automated email is sent out first when a user clicks on ‘Submit’.\nChanging the order of rule execution\n​\tFor more information on other rules that can be applied, go to Rules for a full listing of what is available.\nMake sure to save your work as you go by clicking on the Save button.\nRepeat the steps above to add another email rule to another field, or try other rule, for example a Workflow rule as shown below.\nAdding a second Workflow rule called Hide and Disable In the Training Process example, there is a second form that is part of this process, called Training Approval. From our Training Process requirements the Approval form will have 7 fields, and 1 rule. The fields include a field group, a banner and a list and a Workflow added to a radio list called ‘Management decision’. The added Workflow rule is called Hide and Disable, so based on user input, if someone clicks ‘Yes’ for the ‘Management decision, then a Signature field is shown to sign off on the form, if ‘No’ is clicked then the Signature field is hidden and a text box called ‘Reason’ is shown.\nSelect a field in a form to apply the rule to, in this example a field called ‘Management Decision’ in a Training Approval field.\nTo use a Workflow rule, click on Add a rule \u003e Workflow \u003e Hide and Disable in the right-hand pane.\nAdd Hide and Disable rule\nIn the Edit rule - Hide or Disable dialog box, fill out the Title, in this example ‘Hide or Show’, then click on Edit conditions.\nClick on Add a conditions group. First we need to a) create a condition, click into the first field and drill down to the field in the form you want to base an action on, in this example, ‘Management decision’, then click on the operator field, in this case we choose Equals and in the third value field type in one of the possible values for this field, in this example ‘Yes’. Then click on OK.\nNote: There are 13 possible operators to choose from: Equals, Not equals, Contains, Greater than, Greater or equal, Less than, Less or equal, Is blank, Not blank, Matches pattern, Does not match pattern, Is Visible, Is Enabled.\nIn the Edit rule dialog box, that the first part of the condition appears see blue text ‘Management Decision Equals Yes’. We then need to b) create an action for the condition. Click on the field under Action and drill down to a field within a form, in this example the Signature field in the form Training Approval. Then click on the arrow beside the action to choose, in this example Show.\nNote: there are 7 possible actions in this list: Hide, Show, Disable, Enable, Toggle visible, Toggle enable, Hide and clear.\nClick on Add to add a second part to the action, in this example to hide the feedback field upon a Management Decision of ‘Yes’. Click on the first field and drill down to the field of interest, in this example ‘Feedback’ which we will then ‘Hide’.\nClick on Add otherwise action, in this example to add the actions based on a ‘Management Decision’ of ‘No’.\nDrill down to the fields of choice, and click on the actions to add the reverse of the first action group.\nClick on OK when complete. Make sure to save your work as you go by clicking on the Save button. Depending on the fields you use, for example user picker or lists, you can connect to a datasource to ensure information used in forms is always up to date. Click on the link to find out how to add a datasource and use it in a form field, for example a list.\nWhat’s next The next steps are:\nConnect your data Preview the design User tips Make sure that you change the field properties to make fields Required, Enabled and so on, to ensure that the form appears the way you want, see Properties to find out more about properties. For example unchecking Enabled makes the field visible but not possible to edit. By default there are 3 buttons with every form, Submit, Save and Close. To remove a button, simply click on it and then click on the Bin/Trash button or to add a new button of choice, go to Controls \u003e Actions \u003e Button see Controls for a full list of controls. There are additional form settings that can be used, available in the right-hand pane of Designer. Click on a form in the process, then click on the Settings button to set additional settings such as Enable process security. This value can be checked and a group selected, so that only these users can access the form. Groups are added from Side menu \u003e Administration \u003e Users, click on Create new group to add users to a group, for example HR Team. There are many ways to then reuse elements within forms, for example using the Group field and cloning, see the video Reusability of process and form components. There are many ways to manage who has access to a process, or form, see the video How to control user security access to forms and process.

Forms can connect to any number of data sources or connectors at the same time. The form might be a simple contact form or something else more complex, and you can add more forms like “Follow-up form” or even a “Closure form”.\nAlthough Kianda aims to be intuitive and easy to get started, it is never difficult to over-engineer. So at Kianda we always recommend doing some simple planning before you design your first form.\nIt could be something as simple as a quick flow chart or as we use a spreadsheet where you quickly log the key components, fields or rules that should be needed in the process.\nIn general, we normally include the following key steps to build a process in an agile manner:\nPlan process design, forms, fields, rules, log into design spreadsheet. Build forms and fields connecting to data where applicable. Publish to dashboards, anonymous forms or SharePoint for end-user distribution. Platform getting started video\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Kianda Designer Kianda process designer provides an intuitive interface where you can quickly start building forms for any use case.\nThe key components of the form designer are:\nLeft side panel containing both controls and rules that can be added to forms. The central area is where the current form canvas is displayed. The right panel is where the currently selected component properties and rules are displayed. Form designer key components\nResponsive form layout Form fields are made to with a mobile-first approach giving you design once and deploy everywhere opportunity.\nBy using the Layout option under the property panel you will be able to simply define the layout of your fields or panels within a form. Clicking on the ^ quickly uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.\nThis allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows designing web interfaces with a mobile-first approach.\nForms \u0026 layout fields Kianda comes with several pre-defined field widgets. In case none of these satisfies your specific needs and if you have some level of development skills you can always create your custom field widget.\nAt the time of writing, the default fields fall into four main categories of fields:\nInput - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields. Layout - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields. Action - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components. Custom - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields available under your developer section. Layout fields take an important role when building a modern user interface and allow you to achieve the pixel perfect layout you want.\nModel dialogs Model dialogs are a special form of layout fields. It allows a form designer to define an interface with the key intention of grabbing users attention to something important.\nTypically we use dialogs for things like requiring user confirmation or to let them make a final decision.\nHow to use a model dialog\nYour browser does not support the video tag. On the example above, we use a modal dialog to display a simple warning to the user. The following are the steps:\nOn the Layout components, select the Dialog. Click on the dialog component to insert other fields within it. You can add any field to your dialog, in this case, we are adding a Rich text. To preview how your dialog box will be displayed, you can use the Preview button, on the dialog component. Forms Forms are an important component of any process, they might be used as stages of a process and could be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).\nThe key rules for working with forms are:\nForms are assignable - means that only a form assignee can edit a particular form. This can be a combination of users and groups. Only form owners can edit a given form by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode. Multi-step processes use the concept of “current form”. Only the form matching the process status will be made editable. In a multi-step process, other forms that are not “current form” can be configured to activate with the current form. Meaning they might also be editable and will form a form group. The rules above work together to determine if the form is in edit mode or display mode. Form designers have at their disposal business rules such as assign form, go to form and submit rule to dynamically control the ability for end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.\nHow to add new form\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Click on Add form, on the top right side of the page. Give your form a title. The name is a unique identifier - you can leave it as it is. You can define an owner to the form. Activate with will decide when the form will be active - if you leave it blank, the new form will be activated sequentially after the first form is submitted. Select Submit mode - you can submit just the current form or all forms that are in edit mode. Check Enable quick actions if you want the form to be edited or re-assigned. Provide a user or group in the Quick action user (s) to whom you would like to permit to re-assign or edit the form. Anonymous Forms Anonymous forms are a great way of allowing people outside of your organisation to interact with your processes.\nIt could be something as simple as a contact form or a feedback form but as we all know a contact form never ends with the contact submission. There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result back to the person that started the submission.\nWe have seen a few examples of how people use anonymous forms in Kianda. From simple feedback forms to GDPR data requests that hope between multi divisions before sending back a response to the requester with the level of information held by the organization.\nAnonymous forms can be embedded in iframes and safely displayed within other web-based applications.\nIn Kianda there are effectively 2 types of anonymous forms\nNew process anonymous form Existing process anonymous form New instance anonymous form URL To set up a globally available link for allowing external users to create a new instance, perform the following steps within the form designer:\nOn the top right corner of the designer click on the settings button. Then click the option “Enable anonymous sharing of forms” to Yes. Click the button “New Link” to generate a new anonymous link. Existing instance anonymous form URL To setup existing instance anonymous form one needs to use the anonymous form rule to generate a new anonymous link at the runtime that will point to an existing process record that can then be shared with external users.\nNote that for this to work steps 1 and 2 of New Instance Anonymous form is still required.\nThe following are some of the key options of the anonymous link rule:\nForm to share (any form within an existing process). Link expires settings: Number of uses, time-based or never expire. Message to display on submission. Important: There can be only one active link of each type for a given process. Once a new anonymous link is created for a process it will automatically expire the previous of the same type if a link existed.\nInput fields Kianda forms usability is brought to life with the help of the various input fields available that are specifically adapted to work in mobile, tablet or desktop modes.\nFrom the textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table, Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be adjusted to work with a myriad of scenarios.\nKey properties of fields:\nEach field comes with its own set of settings like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input.\nThe following are some of the common settings of input fields:\nTitle - Every field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user. Required - This Boolean property allows making a field mandatory or not. Visible - Displays the field in the form or not. Layout - Defines both desktop or mobile layout. Cascading dropdown The List field provides the opportunity to define an unlimited level cascading dropdown hierarchy very easily.\nTo achieve that you might connect your list to a data source table or SharePoint list then use the list data source conditions options to filter its content based on a parent list.\nHow to create cascading dropdowns\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Input validation Validating input in forms is quick and easy. Simply enable the required flag of an input field and it will automatically prevent users from submitting it empty.\nThe required flag will conveniently be ignored in case the field is not visible, this will allow you to configure conditionally mandatory fields.\nAnother way of validating input is to use the validate input rule this allows greater flexibility in terms of when or what to validate.\nCloning In the form designer, almost any of the components can be cloned. This will increase your productivity considerably and will make creating multi-step processes a breeze.\nTo clone either a field, a panel or even a form, simply select the component then click the clone button in the properties panel in the right-hand side of the panel.\nIf cloning a field, the cloning dialog box will prompt for the destination of the new cloned field, once your choice is made, simply click ok.\nCloning a form\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Custom fields The Custom fields section provides access to fields that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. It is particularly useful in those situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.\nCustom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. These custom fields can be built by developers. It allows a developer to build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes. Check-out the development section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.\nAdvanced techniques Like the cascading dropdown discussed above, several other advanced scenarios can be easily configured in Kianda. Here is a short-list:\nRepeating section - A repeating section can be created by adding a panel to a table field. This table can be configured to include a single column made of the panel that itself will include the repeating fields of your repeating section. The capture of media - Kianda enables mobile users to directly capture pictures, video or audio just like a native application. Background save - By making use of PWA principles (Progressive Web Application), Kianda allows the ability to perform background operations. This is useful when, for example, a mobile user picks-up their phone to perform a quick action and places it back in his pocket. Operations will continue in the background allowing all data to be captured. Image annotation - Kianda allows for image annotation online or offline. Multi-column / row layout - Making multi-column responsive interfaces is quite easy. Simply add two panels into a form that only use half of the screen (6 columns) then add fields inside panels and you have multiple column layouts. Adding a panel using 12 columns gives you a row. Form tab colour and icon - Form tabs can be quickly customised to display their icons or tab colours, it is also possible to define custom colours for selected and completed form tabs. Hide form tab and left nav - This is self-explanatory, yes you can hide the default navigation elements.

As we saw in Plan your process, you may have paper forms or email flows that you want to turn into dynamic, digital processes.\nDesigning in Kianda To turn your process plan into a Kianda design using the agile approach, follow three simple steps: Build processes, Connect your data, Preview the design.\nDesign process\nWe’ll start with the first step - Build processes.\nBuild processes Building processes involves three steps: creating the process itself, adding forms to the process and then adding controls and rules to the forms.\nBuild process steps\nOnce you have previewed the design, you may wish to go back and make changes to the form, adopting an iterative design approach. We will deal with each step in turn, starting with creating a process.\nBefore you begin To start creating a process, reference your process plan. As we go through the steps involved, we will keep in mind the requirements associated with a Training Request and Approval Process. We will start by creating a first process called Training Process.\nCreate a process To create a process, go to the Left side menu and click on Administration \u003e Designer.\nYou are now in the main process view.

File upload fields can also be useful if you want a file to be generated from the information entered in a form or if you want a file to be sent as part of your process - see Rules for more information.\nFor example, in an Inspection process, you may want the user (an inspector) to be able to upload the details of their inspection as a PDF file or photos as they complete an Inspection Form; or you may want the Kianda system to generate a report based on the information in the Inspection Form and to email this as a PDF file to a supervisor.\nHow to get started To add a File upload field to a form, first open the relevant process.\nSelect the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible).\nClick on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\nSelect Input to view the range of Input controls and click on File. A New field - File dialog box will open with a range of options you can choose from for your new File upload field.\nThe options available in the New field - File dialog box include:\nTitle: You can change the name of the File upload field from the default ‘File 1’\nHelp text: You can insert text to help the form user to complete the File upload field - if you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\nSave location: This is the location the file will be saved to. When you click on the Destination button, a Select datasource dialog box opens in which you can choose where to save the file(s):\nYou can choose to save the file or files to Kianda or to another external data source.\nOpen file behaviour: You can choose whether the file is downloaded or opens in an internet browser.\nFolder structure: If you have chosen an external data source as the ‘Save location’ for the file(s) uploaded to the file upload field, you can then choose the folder structure you want to use for saving the files to that external data source.\nAllow file override: You can choose whether or not to allow file override. If you choose ‘Yes’, if a user goes back into the form and uploads another file to the File upload field, this will override the original file they had uploaded. This option works in conjunction with the Allow uploading multiple files option - if you choose to allow multiple files to be uploaded, then the ‘Allow file override’ option is no longer relevant (as uploading more files will not override file/files already uploaded).\nAllow remove file: If you select Yes, this allows the form user to come back into the form and remove the file they had previously uploaded, and another option appears - Remove and delete file: if you choose Yes, when the file is removed, it will also be deleted from the location where it was stored; if you choose No, then only the reference to the file is removed from the form.\nAllow uploading multiple files: Choose No to only allow the user to upload one file or choose Yes to allow the user to upload multiple files.\nFile name options: Choose whether to keep the original file name, to have the file name auto generated by the system, or to be based on a form field. If you choose From form field, another option appears - File name field - and you click in the blank field to choose the file name field you want the file name to be:\nFile extension: You can set/limit the type of file(s) that can be uploaded by inserting a specific file type. For example, if you insert .pdf in the File extension box, when the user browses for the file to attach, the file type will automatically be set to .pdf. If you want to allow any type of file to be attached, leave this option blank.\nEnable media capture: If you choose Yes, this enables the user to capture media to upload - on a mobile device, when the user clicks on the Upload button their camera/video recorder will open (depending on whether you’ve selected the file extension to be image or video).\nButton text: By default, the File upload icon has the text Browse, but you can change this here.\nButton icon: By default, the file upload icon is but you can change this by clicking the Button icon drop-down menu and choosing a different icon from the large range of icons available.\nEnable background upload: Select this checkbox to enable files to be uploaded using a background operation. This option is typically used in conjunction with the Enable chunked upload option.\nEnable chunked upload: Select this checkbox to upload files using resumable chunks. This option can be useful if the file size is likely to be large or the network speed is likely to be slow.\nNote: If you select Enable background upload and Enable chunked upload there is an additional step you need to take to ensure that these upload options work. In your form, you need to select each field or button that has a Save process rule applied to it, click on that rule to open the Edit rule dialog box and select the Perform background save checkbox. Then click OK. This will ensure that the upload options you’ve chosen for your File upload field work as intended.\nFor example, you would need to select the ‘Save process’ rule attached to the ‘Save’ button in your form (by clicking on the Save button and then clicking on the Save process rule):\nThis opens the Edit rule - Save form dialog box - check the Perform background save option and then click OK:\nIf the Enable background upload and Enable chunked upload options are chosen and a user completes a form while they are in an area with poor coverage, once the user re-establishes internet connection they will need to go back into Kianda and click the Force refresh button at the top right of the Home page.\nShow uploaded files count: Select Yes to show the number of uploaded files.\nOnce you complete the New field - File dialog box and click OK, a new File upload field is added to your form, with the name you inserted as the Title in the dialog box (by default the title is File 1 unless you change it).\nIn the example of our Inspection Form, the new File upload field (titled Upload photos) added to the form could look like this when a user views it on a mobile phone (to see how your form or field will look on a mobile, view it in Mobile preview by using the Preview option which can be opened by clicking the play button icon ):\nHow to edit, move and delete File upload fields To edit a File upload field:\nSelect the File upload field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s drag handle button ) Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) The Edit field - File dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - File dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started). ​\tYou can make any changes you wish in this dialog box and then click OK to confirm.\nTo move a File upload field, simply:\nSelect the field’s drag handle button Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to within your form. To delete a File upload field from your form:\nSelect the field (by either clicking on the field’s name or its drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button Click on OK to confirm How to edit File upload field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a File upload field, select the field (by clicking on the field title or field drag handle button ) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a File upload field titled ‘Upload photos’ are shown here and include:\nField type - The type of field, in this case a File field. Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Upload photos’. Show title - If this is selected, the File upload field title will be shown in the form. Required - If this is selected, the File upload field will be mandatory for the form user. Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field. Visible - If this is selected, the File upload field will be visible in the form. Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the File upload field as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right). To learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about the File upload control, find out more about the other types of Input fields you can add to a Kianda process:\nDate control List control Number control Table control Text box control Toggle control User picker control ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"File upload controls (fields) can be inserted in a form if you want …","ref":"/docs/platform/controls/input/file-upload/","tags":"","title":"File upload control"},{"body":"Introduction Remember there are three principles to consider when working with forms:\nReading modes: Form users can either use forms in edit mode or read mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review feedback in a form, but not be able to edit/update it. Form owner: The default owner is the person or group that the form is assigned to when the the form is created. By default, only this person or group can edit the form. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups. Current form: Typically there are several forms in a process, and only the form that has the status ‘current form’ is editable. However, in a complex multi-step process, other forms can be configured to activate with the current form, meaning they can also become editable at the same time, creating a form group. These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below.\nNew form dialog box\nThese properties can also change dynamically as a result of rules being applied, see Rules.\nHow to set edit modes Remember forms in process instances are either in edit mode as in they can be edited/changed or read mode where the details are visible but cannot be changed. The actions below refer to making forms editable so if the actions below are not used, then the forms are in read mode.\nForms in process instances will be editable for Default owner(s), that is the form owners defined when the form is created, or a form is edited. Form owners are defined in the New form/Edit form dialog box, shown in part 1 of the image above. When a process instance runs, the form owner can then edit the form in that instance. By default the first form in a process becomes the current form, so only this form will be editable for form owners. However if several forms are activated with the current form, defined when the form is created or edited in the New form/Edit form dialog box, then all forms in that group will be editable by the form owner in a process instance, as shown in part 2 of the image above. By default the Submit mode is only this form meaning that when a process instance is running you can choose only that particular form can have details submitted. Alternatively you can choose all forms in edit mode meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved. For example if several forms are activated together and all are in edit mode then the details of all these forms can be submitted together. Forms can be statically set to allow Quick actions including allowing editing. When a form is created or edited using the New form/Edit form dialog box, clicking on Enable quick actions allows you to statically enable a) reassignment, b) edit, and c) custom actions on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to hide form footer buttons when editing, and to trigger rules on save against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means the user(s) assigns the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the action display mode as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have. Changing form display with rules If you use the Form action rule called Field display mode you can change how a field or form displays dynamically.\nWhen you add this rule, under Action you can choose a field or form and choose from Edit mode or Read mode. How the form or field displays can then be based on a condition using the Edit conditions function.\nFor more information on this rule go to Field Display mode rule.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction Remember there are three principles to consider when …","ref":"/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-display-modes/","tags":"","title":"Form display modes"},{"body":" Your browser does not support the video tag.

For example, a warning message could display to remind the user to complete part of a form before they proceed to the next section. To learn more, go to Modal Dialog control.\nRichtext - The Richtext field is used to create rich content in forms, such as an attractive banner or static html, and provides optimum formatting options. To learn more, go to Richtext control.\nField group - The Field Group control can be used to mirror a group of fields from another form or location and reference those fields in your new form, making process design sleeker and more efficient. To learn more, go to Field group control.\nHow to add, edit, move and delete Layout fields How to add Layout fields To insert a Layout field into your form, click on the field type you want to add from the Layout menu.\nFor example, to add a new panel to your form, click on Panel - a pop-up message will appear saying ‘Field added’ and a panel field with the default name Panel 1 will be added to your form (by default, the title of the new panel will not be shown but you can make it visible by selecting the ‘Show title’ checkbox in the Field properties panel to the right).\nHow to edit Layout fields To edit whatever type of Layout field you have added to your form:\nSelect the field (by either clicking on the field name or on the Drag handle button )\nClick on the Edit Field button (Pen icon) .\nIn our example, we have selected the Panel field by clicking the Drag handle button and can then click on the Edit field button to edit it.\nThis will open up the Edit Field dialog box where you can make various changes (such as changing the Title of the field) and where a variety of options will be available to you, depending on the type of Layout field you have selected.\nHow to move Layout fields To move a Layout field:\nSelect the field’s Drag handle button Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it within your form How to delete Layout fields To delete an input field from your form:\nSelect the field (by either clicking on the field’s name or its Drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button Click on OK to confirm How to edit Layout field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a Layout field, select the field (by clicking on the field title or drag handle button ) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a Panel field titled ‘Existing Qualifications’ are shown here and include:\nField type - The type of field, in this case a Panel.\nTitle - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Existing Qualifications’.\nShow title - If this is selected, the field title will be shown in the form.\nRequired - If this is selected, the field will be a mandatory field that users must complete (denoted by a red asterix next to the field title).\nEnabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field.\nVisible - If this is selected, the field will be visible in the form.\nLayout - The width of the field is denoted by the width of the blue bar. Click on the bar to change the width of the field as it will appear on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right).\nTo learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next We have briefly introduced each of the four types of Layout controls.

This is important if there are multiple rules attached to an item like a button. In this case the order of execution is important and can be modified to suit your needs.\nFor example, you may want a Send email rule to be executed once the Submit button is clicked. This will result in an automated email to a designated person. You may also want to attach a report to this email, a report that is a complete form. In this example a Generate word document rule could be used to generate a report when the Submit button is clicked. In this example the Generate word document rule has to be executed before the Send email rule, so that the Word document can be generated and then attached to the email.\nThe rule order consideration is therefore particularly important when rules are dependent on each other - where the output of one rule is the input of another rule.\nChanging the rule order of multiple rules In the example below we will look at changing the rule order of a Send email rule attached to a Submit button. The Submit, Save and Close buttons by default already have Submit, Save and Close process rules attached, in order to allow form shutdown.\nTo change rule order, when the rule is created:\nClick on the item that has multiple rules attached, for example a Submit button. Click on Rules in the right-hand pane, drag the Send email rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and drag it to the top of the list, before Submit, Save and Close rules. The video below shows an example of a Send email rule being created and saved. The rule is attached to the Submit button. Once the rule is created, by default the new rule goes to the bottom of the list of rules. To move the rule, simply click on it and drag it to where you wish to place it. In this example we want the email sent before any of the shutdown processes like Submit or Save, but after a Generate Inspection rule, so the output from that rule can be used in the Send email rule.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

This approach allows designers to build mobile-responsive applications via rapid User Interface (UI) prototyping. The UI provides an easy way to build an application by clicking, scrolling, and drag and drop of fields. The layout both provides a way to both build the application or process schema, and to capture and monitor data at run-time.\nWhat’s under the ‘hood’? The MVC approach enables user or system-supplied data captured through fields within forms, to react or trigger defined rules associated with fields, forms or processes, via the rules engine.\nThe rules-engine is made of: Rule blocks - these are blocks that unlock specific functionality using a toolkit approach Flexible and declarative conditional logic These two components (rule blocks and conditional logic) are used extensively and recursively by designers to build the required orchestration of actions or rules that interact with data to provide the required functionality for your apps or processes.\nThe rules engine, combined with conditional logic enables designers to build ambitious, progressive web applications or end-to-end digital business processes that offer both a great UI and high performance.\nIn addition to the rules engine, CSS3, HTML5, EmberJS, WebApi and NodeJS are some of the underlying technologies used within the platform.\nWhat makes Kianda great is the simplicity and unbounded flexibility it gives citizen developers and low-code developers alike when building enterprise digital solutions. In summary the Kianda platform provides an ideal interface for rapid prototyping and delivering outcomes quickly.\nWhat does Kianda look like The Kianda user interface is designed to be responsive and intuitive, allowing you to easily create and control your business processes. The Kianda Workspace gives you to ability to manage all your processes and view real-time data presented in dashboards, to guide your business decisions.\nYou can find out more about the Kianda workspace below or go straight to Getting started with Kianda processes to create your first process.\nThe layout of the user interface is as follows:\nCompany logo - the top left-hand corner is reserved uploading your company logos.

The following sections describe security at different levels.\nProcess security settings When you are creating or editing a process in Kianda Designer, you can set security settings for that process. This setting will apply to every record (instance) created from that process. To do this, click on the process in Designer and then, in the right-hand pane, click on the Settings button and select the checkbox beside Enable process security.\nChoose an individual user, groups or partner or combination, to be ‘security users’ and then choose from one of three security modes, as shown in here.\nProcess security settings\nThe three available security levels are listed from lowest to highest. For example, if you choose Security users only can create, view and update means that only the users listed as Process security users – in the example shown here, Mike Balcoome and the Management Team – will be able to access and view process records. No other users will have access to the process records generated by this process.\nProcess security rule Another way to set security is to use one of the Workflow rules called Process security to dynamically change the security settings for a process record (instance). Using this rule allows you to set the same security modes shown in the process settings above, but this can happen based on a particular condition or trigger – for example, clicking the Submit button.\nTo add this rule, open your process in Kianda Designer and select the relevant form. Then, in the left-hand pane, go to Add a rule \u003e Workflow \u003e Process security. In the Edit rule – Process security dialog box, create a condition if desired, and then choose from the type of users who will become security users. Choose from the options: Override to override existing security, or Append if you want to add a new level of access. Click the Enable security checkbox to choose a Process security mode.\nEdit rule – Process security dialog box\nPanel and button security In addition to process and form level security, you can set panel and button security by clicking on a panel or button within a form. Click on the panel or button of choice, click the Edit button (Pen icon) and choose Yes beside Enable security. Click on the Add security button to add users or groups to enable access to the button or panel.\nPanel security within the edit field dialog box\nDashboard security As an end user, when you login to Kianda, you are presented with dashboards and widgets for different processes. The dashboard is made of multiple widgets like tiles, charts, links and lists. Go to Dashboard to find out more about each widget type. You can set security at both a) dashboard level and b) widget level, see Widget security for more details. This section will deal with dashboard level security.\nDashboard level security can only be applied if you have the Administrator role to allow visibility of dashboards and widgets.\nTo apply security to dashboards:\nGo to the existing dashboard page by clicking on Dashboard and the page name in the left-hand side menu.\nClick the Edit button visible in the top menu bar.\nNow in Edit mode, the Settings button is visible. Click on the Settings button.\nThe Edit dashboard page dialog box appears where you can find the Visible to user picker with an option to select Users and/or Groups.\nSelect the correct Users and/or Groups using the dropdown menu.\nMake any other changes you need to the dashboard, see Dashboard for more details.\nClick on OK when you are finished editing the dialog box or Close to exit the dialog box at any time.\nSave the changes you make by clicking on the Save button at the top of the page.\nWidget security Similarly, you can set the visibility for an individual widget on the dashboard like a tile, chart, or list, for example, if you want the dashboard to be visible to everyone and a particular chart on the dashboard only visible to management. This can be achieved by setting the visible to field to the management group as shown below.\nTo apply security to a dashboard widget:\nGo to the existing dashboard page by clicking on Dashboard and the page name in the left-hand side menu.\nClick the Edit button visible in the top menu bar.\nNow in Edit mode, click on the Cog/settings button of the widget.\nThe Edit widget dialog box appears where you can find the Visible to user picker with an option to select Users and/or Groups. The example below shows the dialog box for a List widget.\nIn the Visible to field select the correct Users and/or Groups from the dropdown menu.\nClick on OK when you are finished editing the dialog box or Close to exit the dialog box at any time.\nSave the changes you make by clicking on the Save button at the top of the page.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about Process level security, find out more about other security access levels:\nWorkspace security Single Sign-On Data residency ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction In addition to [Workspace security](, …","ref":"/docs/security/process-level-security/","tags":"","title":"Process security"},{"body":"Introduction There are a number of properties and settings that you can implement to your process and forms.\nSettings and properties\nSettings are available from the right-hand pane and give you the ability to:\nImport processes\nView Version history\nChange Process settings Edit form information by selecting a form and clicking on the Pen button .\nChange a field to another field by clicking on Change field\nCreate a duplicate form by selecting a form, clicking on the Clone button and then click on Ok.

With an offline mode, any information can be saved automatically during the last online access.\nEmphasize benefits to potential clients who are frequently operating in remote areas with no access to the internet.\nPerformance Progressive web apps are faster because of the way the underlying technology caches and serves text, stylesheets, images and other content on the websites. As a result user experience, consistency and conversion rate increase.\nProgressive web apps utilize service workers, which are JavaScript files that run independently from the main browser thread and efficiently control caching, this is how progressive web apps enhance better performance than traditional web apps.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Progressive web applications are the next great trend for the mobile …","ref":"/docs/low-code/pwa/","tags":"","title":"Progressive Web Application (PWA)"},{"body":"Business rules are what make Kianda forms come alive. They represent the actual actions users intend to perform when they interact with form components - for example, sending automated emails, revealing certain parts of a form based on user interactions and automatically generating Word and PDF documents from completed forms.\nThere are 60 predefined rules across 10 categories and they can be applied to fields (controls), forms, groups of forms or even to a whole process - see Rules list for more details.\nThere are two key principles to consider when working with rules:\nRule design - Consider the type of rule you are going to apply and what you are going to apply it to - for example, to a button, field or form. As part of your design considerations it is important to know what you can do with rules, in particular, the use of conditions and expressions.\nRule order - If there are several rules attached to an item like a button, then the order the rules are going to be executed in becomes important. You can change the rule execution order to suit your needs.\nHow to get started If you go to Side menu \u003e Administration \u003e Designer, click on a process or create a new process, and then select a form within the process so that the Edit form button (Pen icon ) appears. The predefined rules will can then be found in the left-hand pane under Add a rule.\nRule categories\nThere are 10 categories of rules available (see Rules list for the full list of names of the 60 predefined rules):\nWorkflow - There are seven workflow rules that represent the actions a user intends to perform when they interact with form components. Communications - There are four communication rules associated with user communication - for example, sending an email or triggering a user alert. Data - There are five data rules associated with database operations like create, update and delete. Users - There are four user rules associated with user properties, allowing user lookup or to update a user. File management - There are seven file management rules concerned with generating documents such as Word, Excel or converting to PDF. Tables - There are 12 table rules associated with table operations such as updating, adding and removing table rows. Dates - There are four date rules to calculate time and format dates. Form actions - There are six form rules linked to actions that are part of forms - for example, submit, close or save. SharePoint - There are 10 SharePoint associated rules such as adding, finding or removing users. KiandaAI - there is one KiandaAI rule related to text analysis. An additional Custom category exists if Kianda Developer has been used to create custom rule widgets - see Developer for more details.\nWhen to use rules You can add rules:\nto a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load) Rule design Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form or field you want to apply the rule to by clicking on that item so that you’re viewing it in edit mode (so the Pen icon appears) - for example, you could select a form called Training Approval or could select a button like Submit to apply a rule or rules to.\nField editing\nClick on Add a rule in the left-hand pane and select the category of rule you want, such as Communications, and then click the particular rule you want to insert within that category, for example User alert.\nRule order If there is more than one rule for an item like a field or button, then you need to consider the order of execution.\nFor example, for a Submit button on a form you may want a Send email rule to be executed first before any other rule is executed. To do this, click on the Submit button to make sure you are in Edit mode, and under Rules in the right-hand pane, drag the Send email rule to the top of the list of rules by clicking on the rule and dragging it to the top.\nRule order\nRules list This table contains a full list of the available predefined rules.\nRules by category and title\nWhat’s next To learn more about control fields, go to Controls.\nTo find out how to get the most out of rules, see Conditions and Expressions.\nTo return to the previous pages click on the links below How Kianda works Plan your process Design and build your process Add forms Designer Properties Add controls and rules ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Business rules are what make Kianda forms come alive.

Anonymous forms so that processes can be shared externally. Dashboards to monitor processes in detail. Options to create custom fields, rules and dashboard widgets Click on each of these links to find out more.\nMultibrowser and multidevice access Kianda is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) which means it can be used across a range of up-to-date browsers, on any platform - Windows, MacOS or Linux - and on any device. As a PWA, this means you can browse Kianda when not online, increasing engagement and availability.\nThis is particularly useful when operating in remote areas - for example, performing a maintenance check of a wind turbine or other equipment in the field, and capturing information in draft form for submission later on back at the office.\nIntuitive Designer Kianda form Designer provides an easy way to build forms and process components.\nThe key components of the form designer are:\nLeft-hand pane is used to add form elements like controls and rules. This pane also houses the Exit Designer Save Preview and Publish buttons. Central form canvas displays the current form you are working on and show the changes you are making in real time. Right-hand pane is used to view and edit process, form and field properties and rules. Kianda Designer\nFor more information, go to Designer and view the following video.\nHow Kianda Designer works\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Predefined fields Kianda comes with 16 predefined field widgets, see Controls for a full list. You can also use Kianda Developer to create custom fields if you have some development experience and none of the predefined field widgets satisfy your specific needs.\nThe default fields fall into four main categories:\nInput - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields. Layout - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields. Action - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components. Custom - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields developed using Kianda Developer. For example, layout fields play an important role when building a modern user interface as they allow you to add Richtext and Dialog boxes. You can use these fields together to create a modal dialog, allowing you as the form designer to create an alert for a form user - for example, when requiring user confirmation or making a final decision or check.\nExample of fields in action - creating a modal dialog\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Responsive form layout Form fields are made to with a mobile-first approach, giving you design once and deploy everywhere opportunity.\nBy using the Layout option in the property panel, you will be able to simply define the layout of your fields or panels within a form. Clicking on the Collapse or expand button quickly uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.\nThis allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows you to design web interfaces with a mobile-first approach. You can see this layout in action in this video.\nEditing forms\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Properties and settings Kianda form usability is brought to life with the help of the various input fields that are specifically adapted to work in mobile, tablet or desktop modes.\nFor each type of input field - such as textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table - Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be adjusted through properties and settings to work with a myriad of scenarios.\nEach field comes with its own range of settings like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input.\nThese are some of the common properties of input fields:\nTitle - Each field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user. Required - Using this checkbox makes a field mandatory for form users to fill in. Visible - Displays the field in the form if checked. Layout - Defines both desktop or mobile layout. In addition to these common properties, each field also has its own range of settings. For example, a list can have data entered manually, via a form, or from an external data source such as SharePoint or Salesforce and that list can be displayed as a dropdown, radio, multiselect or checkbox list.\nConnecting to datasources By connecting Kianda forms to existing external datasources such as lists in SharePoint, Google Drive or SQL tables, your processes will always stay relevant, up-to-date and perform as your data grows, creating a scalable solution.\nThere are currently 19 different predefined data connectors that allow you to connect external data sources to Kianda processes, as outlined in this video.\nExample connecting to a SharePoint datasource\nYour browser does not support the video tag. The example in the video shows how a list field that is connected to SharePoint information can be used in a form, so that as the list grows on SharePoint, the information in the Kianda process will update dynamically.\nThe list field, in conjunction with datasources, allows you to define an unlimited level cascading dropdown hierarchy very easily.\nCascading dropdown example Let’s say, for example, that you have SharePoint or Salesforce lists of customers in different countries and different cities. You can then use the list data source conditions options to filter content based on that parent list.\nThis video shows how cascading lists connected to data sources works in practice.\nHow to create cascading dropdowns\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Multimedia capture When creating forms, there are options to capture user input in a variety of ways - for example, by clicking on radio buttons, selecting options from dropdown lists, entering text, uploading files, capturing images, videos, QR codes and voice input. This video goes through some of the possiblities you have when building forms with Kianda.\nExamples of possibilities with Kianda forms\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Rules Rules are an important component of any process as they can be used to trigger automated actions, requiring minimal user management once created. There are 60 predefined rules in Kianda, covering areas such as workflow applications, communications and file management.\nThis video goes through an example of a rule that sends an automated email once a Submit button is clicked on a form.\nExamples of possibilities with Kianda forms\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Anonymous Forms Anonymous forms are a great way of allowing people outside of your organisation to interact with your processes - for example, simple feedback forms to GDPR data requests that hop between multi divisions before sending back a response to the requester with the level of information held by the organisation.\nEven with a simple contact form or feedback form, the process rarely ends when the form is submitted. There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result that goes back to the person who started the submission.\nAnonymous forms can be embedded in iframes and safely displayed within other web-based applications.\nDashboards Use Kianda’s predefined widgets to create charts in a dashboard page for your process. There are seven different widgets that allow you to visualise different aspects of your process, allowing you to zone in on key data you want to highlight.\nCreating a dashboard\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Creating custom fields The Custom fields section of Kianda, called Developer, provides access to fields that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. It is particularly useful in situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.\nCustom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. If you need to build “an action”, then you should use a custom rule widget.\nCustom fields allow developers to build a reusable component that can then be used by process designers in real processes.\nCheck-out the development section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.\nWhat’s next To start your no-code development journey, follow these simple steps:\nPlan your process\nDesign and build your process\nPublish your process\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"No-Code development involves the creation of applications or business …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/welcome/no-code/","tags":"","title":"What is No-Code Development?"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/low-code/why-choose-lowcode/","tags":"","title":"Why choose low-code development?"},{"body":"Action fields are one category of controls and include the fields that allow user interface actions like buttons or links.\nGetting started with Action controls There are four types of Action fields:\nButton - Buttons can be used to allow user interaction and to enable rules to be applied to actions taken by users. Applying rules to buttons can help to create smart, dynamic forms that follow business logic, without the need for coding. See Rules and Button control to learn more.\nLink - Link fields can be used to create custom links to forms. These can be external links. See Link control for more information.\nImage - Image fields can be used to display images, either statically or from file fields. Go to Image control to find out more.\nSignature - Signature fields provide a very neat way to electronically sign-off on a form or process. To learn more, go to Signature control.\nTo add an Action field to a Kianda form:\nOpen an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer in the left side menu and clicking on a process, or create a new process in Designer. See Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.\nOnce you have opened your process, select the form you want to work on (so that the Edit Form button is shown).\nIn this example, a Training Request form has been selected:\nClick on Controls in the left-hand pane so the Controls menu expands to show the four categories of Controls (fields): Input, Layout, Actions and Custom.\nClick on Actions to see the four types of Action fields: Button, Link, Image and Signature.\nClick on the Action field type you want to insert.\nFor example, to insert an Image field:\nClick on Image A New field - Image dialog box opens automatically, giving you a range of options for your new Image field. Once you complete this dialog box and click OK, the new Image field is inserted into your form. To learn more about the Image field, go to Image control. How to edit, move and delete Action fields To edit whatever type of Action field you have added to your form:\nSelect the field (by either clicking on the field name or on the field’s drag handle button )\nClick on the Edit Field button (Pen icon) The Edit Field dialog box will open, giving you a different range of options to make changes to the Action field - such as changing the Title of the field - depending on the type of Action field you are working with.\nTo move an Action field, simply:\nSelect the field’s Drag handle button Drag and drop the Action field wherever you want to move it within your form.\nFor example, the ‘Training Documentation’ Link field shown here can be moved in the form by selecting the drag handle button and dragging and dropping it wherever you want to put it:\nTo delete an Action field from your form:\nSelect the Action field (by either clicking on the field’s title or its drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button Click on OK to confirm. How to view and edit Action control Field Properties To view or edit an Action control’s Field properties:\nSelect the Action field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s drag handle button ).\nThe Field Properties associated with the Action field will be displayed (and can be changed) in the Field properties menu on the right-hand side.\nFor example, the Field properties associated with a Link field titled ‘Training Documentation’ are shown here:\nField type - The type of field, in this case a Link field. Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Training Documentation’. Show title - If this is selected, the field title will be shown in the form. Required - If this is selected, the field will be mandatory for the form user to complete (and a red star will be shown next to the field title to denote this). Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit the field. Visible - If this is selected, the field will be visible in the form. Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the field as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right). ​\tFor more details, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next We have briefly introduced each of the four types of Action fields. Now let’s look at each of these Action fields in more detail:\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Action fields are one category of controls and include the fields that …","ref":"/docs/platform/controls/actions/","tags":"","title":"Actions"},{"body":"Conditions are a key component of Kianda rules. They are the triggers that result in fully dynamic forms and add an important level of interactivity, creating pathways within a process based on user interaction.\nConditions work on the ‘if…then…else’ principle: ‘if’ the condition exists ’then’ an action happens, ’else’ another action happens. There are three parts to applying a condition to a rule (depending on the rule that is used):\nCreate the condition(s) Create the action(s) that will be applied as a result of the first condition being in place Create the otherwise action(s) based on other conditions being in place For example, let’s take a simple Training Request and Approval Process, whereby an employee fills out a request form, the details of which are sent to a manager for review in an approval form. In this approval form, the manager can either a) approve the request with a signature or b) not approve the request and provide feedback on why.\nTraining Process flowchart\nA condition is created based on the Manager Decision radio list:\nCondition: If the decision is ‘Yes’ Action: Then the Signature button appears Otherwise action: Else the decision is ‘No’ and the Feedback text box appears One of the most commonly used rules that uses conditions is the Workflow rule Hide or Disable. This is used as an example in the video and in the Getting started section below.\nUsing conditions in rules: Example of Hide or disable\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Getting started with conditions Conditions are recognisable in Kianda from the Conditions button found in rules and dashboards.\nTo create a condition:\nSelect a form or forms, field or fields and then, a rule, for example Hide or disable, as found in the left side menu \u003e Add a rule \u003e Workflow \u003e Hide or Disable. Click on Edit conditions. Click on Add a conditions group. In the Edit conditions dialog box, choose from the elements below, by drilling down to the form(s) or field(s) that you want to apply the rule to. Condition elements\nIn the case of multiple conditions, you can use And or Or to create compound conditions.\nCompound conditions\nClick on OK. Create the actions and, where applicable, otherwise actions. The action will depend on the rule that is chosen. For example, for the Workflow rule, Hide or Disable, click on the field under Action and choose the form(s) or field(s) where you want an action applied. Action elements for Hide and Disable\nThen click on the field for actions and choose one of seven possible actions to apply.\nThe actions within Hide or disable are:\na) Hide will hide a process element (forms or fields) from view\nb) Show will show the element\nc) Disable blocks a user from editing an element\nd) Enable allows a user to add a value to an element\ne) Toggle visible will toggle between showing an element or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to\nf) Toggle enable will toggle between allowing an element to be edited or not, based on subsequent clicks of a field that the rule is applied to\ng) Hide and clear will allow you to hide a process element and clear the details. For example, if a toggle button has this rule applied, with an otherwise action of show as actions on a textbox, then if one value is chosen on the toggle button, the user is allowed enter details into the textbox, otherwise the field is hidden and cleared of data so that no data can be retrieved; this may be useful for sensitive information like a social security number on a form.\nClick on + Add to add more actions.\nClick on Add otherwise action to add more actions based on other values for the condition.\nThe video demonstrates how a condition works within the Hide and Disable rule and highlights that multiple groups of conditions can be used to impact multiple actions to create highly sophisticated form interactions.\nUser tip You can use rules to create actions without conditions too. In this case, the rule will simply execute - for example, when the form or field is clicked on.\nWhat’s next To learn more about controls (fields) go to Controls.\nTo find out more about how expressions are used in rules go to Expressions.\nTo return to the previous pages click on the links below Plan your process\nRules\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Conditions are a key component of Kianda rules.

Your data may be held in datasources like SharePoint, Salesforce or SAP. Kianda comes with 19 predefined data connectors allowing you to connect to these datasources, see data connector list for a full listing.\nIf you are a developer and want to connect to a datasource that is not included in the predefined set, you can use SOAP or REST to create your own API for data transfer.\nConnecting to data happens during the process design phase, see image below.\nDesign process\nYou can set up data connectors first, before building your process if you wish, and then link those data connectors when adding controls and rules.\nThe video below highlights how to connect to a datasource, in this example, SharePoint and How to get started runs through the process in steps including an example of how to use this datasource in a list field.\nConnecting to a datasource using SharePoint\nYour browser does not support the video tag. How to get started In this example, we will connect to a SharePoint list called ‘Types of Training’ to use a List field in a form called ‘Training Request’.

This agile approach results in significantly faster development time which is cost effective and reduces risk.\nAgile development cycle\nThe main phases of an agile project are:\nPlanning - this involves determining the scope of the project, namely what is it you want to achieve, what end-users will be supported and how. The outcome will be a list of requirements that can be adjusted as the process is developed. Design - this involves constructing one ore more draft processes. Previewing the draft is included in this phase and there may be several rounds of revisions. Launch - this phase includes piloting the process with a number of users, monitoring results, getting feedback and then releasing the process including all related documentation. Mapping these phases to process creation in Kianda, results in three main steps: Plan \u003e Design \u003e Publish. Each step contains three substeps.\nCreating your Kianda processes in an agile way Three steps to create a process\nUsing Kianda allows you to leverage the agile development process to maximum effect:\nPlan - our documentation will guide you when it’s time for you to capture your requirements.\nWhat forms and fields do you need in your process based on what you want to do?\nWhat rules can be applied to create smart, automated processes?\nWho needs access to the forms as a user and form owner? Review these questions as you modify the process. Design - you can create draft processes and restore to earlier versions, allowing you complete control over production.\nProcesses are made up of interactive forms which you can create at the click of a button.\nForms connect to your datasources so, as your organisation changes, your processes respond accordingly.\nUse the in-built previewer to preview and test your design, then save new versions as you modify your process design.

This is a straight forward rule which allows you to connect to your data source and map inputs. You can also map a data source field or text back to Kianda on success or store an error message on failure.\nDelete item - This rule works exactly like Update item rule. To delete an item from your data connection, you could use a data source filter and map data source field or text from a data connection to Kianda form field.\nUpdate item - At any point, if you would like to update any item on your data connection, use this rule. To find an item to update, you could use a data source filter and map the input fields or text.\nFind Items - Use this rule together with a datasource to perform a query and return data for use with the form. To find an item, you could use a data source filter which acts as a conditional bridge between Kianda and data-connections. If the condition is true, you could map the data source field or text to the Kianda form field.\nSet form field - This rule is used to update the value of fields in a form. The field value could be simple text or based on a custom expression with the ability to define JavaScript expressions. Use this rule to copy content between fields or to apply a custom expression to set the value of a given field.\nWhat’s next We have briefly introduced each of the five types of Data rules.

Forms are an important component of any process. They might be used as a stage of a process and can be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).\nThere are 3 key principles to consider when working with forms:\nForm design - what a form looks like, what elements it contains, for example controls and rules, see Designer layout Form interaction- how users can use forms depending on certain sequences happening, see Rules Form management - who can edit and access forms is set when creating a new form, see New forms Designer layout To access processes, go to the left-hand pane and Administration \u003e Designer and click on a process that you have created or imported, see Design and build your process.\nFrom the main process view, click on any process to add forms, for example Training process as seen below.\nMain process view The designer window opens and is made up of 3 main parts.\nKianda Designer\nThe key components of the designer are:\nLeft-hand pane is used to add form elements like controls and rules. This pane also houses the Exit Designer Save Preview and Publish buttons. Central form canvas displays the current form you are working on. Right-hand pane is used to view and edit process, form and field properties. Note the name of the process you are working on is shown in the top menu bar, for example Training Process.\nThe video below demonstrates how to get started using Kianda Designer, and go to How to get started to follow through on different ways to import forms or start from scratch.\nIntroduction to Kianda Designer\nYour browser does not support the video tag. How to get started How you get started with forms depends on:\nif you have created a process using the App Store, see Predefined forms\nif you have created a process from scratch or want to create a form from scratch, see New forms\nif you import forms that have already been created, see Import forms\nOnce your form is created, you are ready to start adding elements to your form, see Add controls and rules.\nIn addition there are a number of settings you can change, see Settings and Properties.\nPredefined forms If you have created a process using the App Store, then a number of forms will already be part of the process. For example the process Security Incident Management has 5 forms attached: Incident detail, Data breach, Malware outbreak, Root cause remedy and Caller review.\nTo edit form details, simply click on a form and click on the Pen button to edit the form. You can also click on the Add form button to add a new form. Edit options are shown under New forms.\nNew forms If you have created a process from scratch, an empty form is added to your process by default, called “form 1”. This is the first form. Click on this form and the Pen button to customise it. You can also click on the Add form button to add a new form.\nAdding a form\nThere are a number of edit options below.\nEditing a form\nNote: as you change any of the options in the dialog box, the impact will be shown in real-time on the form in the background, for example a title, or colour form theme.\nTitle - the form title, for example Employee Request Form\nName - this is a unique name for the form\nDefault owner(s) - by default the form creator is an owner. You can remove this owner by clicking on and add other owners by clicking on the arrow and choose from Users, Groups or Partners.\nUsers - allows you to choose individual owners Groups - allows you to choose from defined groups for example HR Team or Management Team Partners - allows you to choose predefined partner organisations that you want to share with or provide permissions Activate with - will decide when the form will be active. If you have several forms attached to a process, then select from a dropdown list the form you want to activate with the current form. If you leave the field blank, the new form will be activated sequentially after the first form is submitted.\nSubmit mode - options are a) Only this form (the current form) or b) All forms in edit mode\nForm icon - click on the arrow to choose from hundreds of icons to attach to your form.\nForm theme - choose from Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White Colours for your form.\nEnable quick actions - if you tick the checkbox, you can select from the options a) Enable re-assign b) Enable edit and c) Enable custom action. Click on Ellipsis button to further modify the action settings.\nIf you click on Enable re-assign, you can reassign action settings to particular Users, Groups or Partners. Click on Allow form owners if you want form owners to be able to reassign actions.\nIf you click on Enable edit, you can allow certain Users, Groups or Partners to edit the form, along with form owners by clicking on Allow form owners.\nOther options include a checkbox for When editing auto hide form footer buttons and Trigger rules on save.\nIf you check Trigger rules on save then click into the Save action field to choose from an action trigger as to when the form is saved, for example Submit, Save or Close. These can be other actions depending on what you have defined.\nEdit action settings\nIf you click on Enable custom action, you can allow certain Users, Groups or Partners to edit the form, along with form owners by clicking on Allow form owners.\nOther options include Action label, Target action field and Action display mode, for example Read-only mode, Edit mode or Both.\nCustom action settings\nAs a form designer you can set up actions dependent on certain conditions, for example an Action label that targets a certain button appearing for example Close button, only when a certain display mode is chosen, for example Read-only mode. If Edit mode is chosen, then the button will only appear when the form is being edited. In this way you can create dynamic forms that suit user interactions.\nClick on the OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\nTo save your changes to the form, click on the Save button .\nYou are now ready to start adding Controls and rules to your form. You can also implement additional settings see Process Settings.\nImport forms You can import a previously designed form by clicking on the Import button .\nClick on the arrow to select from the drop down list to Select a process design.\nClick on a process of interest and then click on the forms to import. Forms are indicated by a + symbol and can be expanded to show elements within a form for example a panel containing different fields such as lists and text boxes. This means you can import a whole form, or just elements of a form. In this way you can very quickly reuse some or all parts of an existing form.\nImporting from another process\nClick on the OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\nAdding form elements If you have added a new form during the form creation process, then a blank canvas with 3 default buttons are available to you: Submit, Save and Close.\nDefault form buttons\nGo to Add controls and rules to find out more about adding form elements. Move elements by clicking on the Drag Handle beside the item and dragging it to where you want to place it.

ProcessLink() is a function that will return a link to that process instance. Using the expressions above in an email will mean that every time an instance of the process runs, the values will be presented in an automated email, creating greater efficiencies and personalising the email for the recipient.\nGetting started with expressions – example Email body text Expressions are recognisable in Kianda from the Expressions button found in Edit rule dialog boxes and other menu items, such as enabling quick actions for processes and number fields.\nWithin rules, expressions can be created using the Expression builder where you can Add field to an expression or use the handy Reference guide to get a list of commonly used functions.\nExpression builder\nNow let’s go step by step through the process of adding an expression to the Body section of an email being sent using the Send email rule:\nFirst, add a Send email rule to a form or forms, field or fields by selecting Add a rule \u003e Communications\u003e Send email from the left-side pane. In the Body section of the email (under Action), click on the *Expressions* button . Click on the blank box under Add field to expression and find the field you want to reference in your email – for example, a text box titled EmployeeName. Click Add to expression. Click OK. To add additional field expressions, click on the *Expressions* button again, under Add field to expression, click on X beside the field name to clear the expression box and then search for the desired field from a form. To add a function, click on Reference and copy the function into the body of the email. A list of references are available below. Expression functions All JavaScript expressions and functions can be used in the Expression builder to create the impact you want.\nIn addition to defining your own expressions there is a set list of expressions found under References, see table below for meaning.\nExpression Function +, -, /, * Performs one of the basic mathematical operations: add, subtract, divide or multiply. Sum(arg1, arg2, …) Returns the sum of the arguments listed between the parentheses. Date(arg1) Converts the argument into a date. DateAdd(dateArg, day, month, year, hour, min) Adds time to a given date. The date is stored in dateArg and the time to be added is stored in the day, month, year, hour and min arguments. Status() Returns the status of the current process. ProcessID() Returns the ID of the current process. FormOwner(formName) Returns the form owner(s) for the given form. FormCompleted(formName) Returns the date completed for the given form. Pad(value, size, symbol) Adds left padding to the value with the symbol provided. QueryString(parameter) Returns the URL query string for the given parameter (or an empty string if undefined). IsOnline() Returns “yes” or “no” depending on the status of the online connection. ProcessLink() Returns the HTML link to the current process The link text can be added between the parantheses e.g. ProcessLink(“click here”). This expression is for use in emails and rich text fields. Digest() Returns a summary of changes to fields in the current process. A table will be given with the original and new values. Digest(‘fieldName1’,‘fieldName2’) Returns a summary of the changes for the given fields. See note below. GetFieldText(‘fieldName’) Returns the text in the given field. See note below. GetFieldValue(‘fieldName’) Returns the value in the given field. See note below. Note: In the case of the last three expressions, you should select a field which contains data. If you give the name of a button field for example, then no data will be returned.\nWhat’s next To find out more about rule implementation, go to the main Rules page and then click on the links to the different rule categories.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction Expressions allow you to put together form identifiers …","ref":"/docs/platform/rules/general/expression-builder/","tags":"","title":"Expression builder"},{"body":"List fields (controls) can be manually entered into a form or can be linked to from an external site like SharePoint. There are different display options - from dropdown lists to checklists - as well as other options (like the ability to make a list field mandatory for a user to complete).\nFor example, you could insert a list field in your form that will show a drop-down list of Types of Training that is maintained on SharePoint. The advantage of linking to an external data source like this is that your list will stay up-to-date with any changes made to the list on SharePoint.\nHow to get started To add a List field to a form, first open the relevant process.\nSelect the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible). If you want to add the List field to a panel within your form, first select the panel by clicking on it and then add the List field.\nClick on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\nSelect Input to view the range of Input controls and click on List. A New field - List dialog box will open with a range of options you can choose from for your new List field.\nThe options available in the New field - List dialog box include:\nTitle - You can change the name of the List field from the default title List 1. For example, if you are working on a Training Request form, you may want to insert a List field to contain the types of training and may choose to title this ‘Type of Training’.\nName - This is a unique name for the field.\nHelp text - You can insert text to help the form user to complete the List field. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted. In this example, the list field is titled ‘Type of Training’ and has associated help text:\nList source - You have three main options in terms of the source of the choices that will appear in your List field:\na) Entered manually b) Form data c) Data source\nWe will look at each of these three list source options in turn.\nIf you select the Entered manually checkbox, you must then manually type the choices you want to appear in your list into the List source box. Three default choices are shown - simply replace these with the choices you want to appear in your list (keeping the same format of one choice per line). You can insert more than three choices.\nIf you select the Form data checkbox (so the source of your list options is a form field), then the box under List source will now show the instruction ‘Select a form field…’ and two further options will appear below this - Display field and Value field.\nClick into the List source box and select the form field you wish to use as your List source and then choose a Display field (the field used to display values) and Value field to specify how you want to map the values from your data source into your list field.\nSelect the Data source checkbox if you want to use an external data source as the source for the choices to appear in your list:\nThen click on the Datasource button to open the Select datasource dialog box and choose the data source you want to connect to - for example, SharePoint. For more information on how to connect to data sources in Kianda, go to Data connectors.\nOnce you’ve selected a data source, click OK - a range of new options will now be shown below the Datasource button in the New field - List dialog box.\nSelect the Display field, Value field and a field to Sort by (the ‘Sort by’ option appears once you’ve selected a data source). Once you’ve chosen a field to sort by, an additional option - Direction - appears, enabling you to choose to sort values in Ascending or Descending order. In the example shown here, Kianda has been chosen as the data source and a field titled ‘Type of Training’ from a form called ‘Training Request’ has been chosen as both the Display field and Value field.\nClick on the Edit conditions button if you want to add a condition to your List field - for example, if you want to create a cascading list where the options available in a second list are dependent upon the option the user has chosen from a first list. To learn more about applying conditions, go to Conditions and to find out more about creating cascading lists, watch the video on How to create cascading dropdown lists.\nIf you choose Kianda as the data source for your list field, two additional options will be displayed - Query any process (checks all processes within Kianda for the field you have selected as the source for your list) and Query type (you can select anything created by or assigned to a particular user).\nOnce you’ve selected your List source and the various options associated with it, complete the remaining options in the New field - List dialog box:\nEnable offline cache - You can choose this option to make list data available when offline (only available for lists with less than 500 options). Display format - You can choose to have your list field appear as either a Drop-down list, a Radio list, Multi-select or a Checkbox list. By default, the Dropdown list radio button is selected, along with two additional options - Filter mode (you can choose either ‘Starts With’ or ‘Contains’) and Enable native selector on mobile (so a user completing the list field on their mobile phone can use the default list selector on it).\nIf you choose Radio list or Checkbox list you can choose a List display position of either Vertical or Horizontal.\nOnce you complete the New field - List dialog box and click OK button, a new List field is added to your form, with the name you inserted as the Title in the dialog box (by default, the title is List 1 unless you change it).\nIf we take the example of a Training Request form with a list field that contains the different types of training a user can request, the list field (which is titled ‘Type of Training’ and has a drop-down list format) could look like this when a user views it on their mobile phone:\nTo see how your form or field will look like on a mobile, view it in Mobile preview by clicking the Preview button (play icon) after first saving your changes.\nHow to edit, move and delete File upload fields To edit a List field:\nSelect the field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s Drag handle button ) Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) The Edit field - List dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - List dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).\nYou can make any changes you wish in this dialog box and then click OK to confirm.\nTo move a List field, simply\nSelect the field’s drag handle button Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to within your form To delete a List field from your form:\nSelect the field (by either clicking on the field’s name or its drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button Click on OK to confirm. How to edit List field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a List field, select the field (by clicking on the field title or field drag handle button ) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a List field titled ‘Type of Training’ are shown here and include:\nField type - The type of field, in this case a List field. Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Type of Training’. Show title - If this is selected, the List field title will be shown in the form. Required - If this is selected, the List field will be mandatory for the form user. Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field. Visible - If this is selected, the List field will be visible in the form. Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the List field as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right). To learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about List controls, find out more about the other types of Input fields you can add to a Kianda process:\nDate control File upload control Number control Table control Text box control Toggle control User picker control ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"List fields (controls) can be manually entered into a form or can be …","ref":"/docs/platform/controls/input/list/","tags":"","title":"List control"},{"body":"The Kianda platform is a modern low-code and no-code development platform. It enables developers and non-developers (citizen developers) to build ambitious web based business applications of any kind.\nIn this documentation you will find the information that will let you build beautiful mobile-ready web applications or simple forms that orchestrate into a functional digital business process using the Kianda low-code and no-code approach.\nIn summary the Kianda platform provides an ideal interface for rapid prototyping and delivering outcomes quickly. Kianda Designer is the main interface for designing processes. Designer components are explained below.\nHow to get started with Kianda Designer The key components of the form designer are:\nLeft panel The central area is where the current form canvas is displayed. The right panel is where the currently selected component properties and rules are displayed. Form designer key components\nResponsive form layout Form fields are made to with a mobile-first approach giving you design once and deploy everywhere opportunity.\nBy using the Layout option under the property panel you will be able to simply define the layout of your fields or panels within a form. Clicking on the ^ quickly uncovers the layout mode for desktop and mobile.\nThis allows you to specify a layout made of 1 to 12 columns and is based on bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows designing web interfaces with a mobile-first approach.\nForms \u0026 layout fields Kianda comes with several pre-defined field widgets. In case none of them satisfies your specific needs and if you have some level of development skills you can always create your custom field widget.\nAt the time of writing, the default fields fall into four main categories of fields:\nInput - Input fields include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields. Layout - Layout fields are the fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields. Action - Action fields are fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components. Custom - Under custom fields, you will find any custom-developed fields available under your developer section. Layout fields take an important role when building a modern user interface and allow you to achieve the pixel perfect layout you want.\nModel dialogs Model dialogs are a special form of layout fields. It allows a form designer to define an interface with the key intention of grabbing users attention to something important.\nTypically we use dialogs for things like requiring user confirmation or to let them make a final decision.\nHow to use a model dialog\nYour browser does not support the video tag. On the example above, we use a modal dialog to display a simple warning to the user. The following are the steps:\nOn the Layout components, select the Dialog. Click on the dialog component to insert other fields within it. You can add any field to your dialog, in this case, we are adding a Rich text. To preview how your dialog box will be displayed, you can use the Preview button, on the dialog component. Forms Forms are an important component of any process, they might be used as stages of a process and could be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).\nThe key rules for working with forms are:\nForms are assignable - means that only a form assignee can edit a particular form. This can be a combination of users and groups. Only form owners can edit a given form by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode. Multi-step processes use the concept of “current form”. Only the form matching the process status will be made editable. In a multi-step process, other forms that are not “current form” can be configured to activate with the current form. Meaning they might also be editable and will form a form group. The rules above work together to determine if the form is in edit mode or display mode. Form designers have at their disposal business rules such as assign form, go to form and submit rule to dynamically control the ability for end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.\nHow to add new form\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Click on Add form, on the top right side of the page. Give your form a title. The name is a unique identifier - you can leave it as it is. You can define an owner to the form. Activate with will decide when the form will be active - if you leave it blank, the new form will be activated sequentially after the first form is submitted. Select Submit mode - you can submit just the current form or all forms that are in edit mode. Check Enable quick actions if you want the form to be edited or re-assigned. Provide a user or group in the Quick action user (s) to whom you would like to permit to re-assign or edit the form. Anonymous Forms Anonymous forms are a great way of allowing people outside of your organisation to interact with your processes.\nIt could be something as simple as a contact form or a feedback form but as we all know a contact form never ends with the contact submission. There is always a process or a series of steps behind each public/anonymous form that might culminate with an actionable result back to the person that started the submission.\nWe have seen a few examples of how people use anonymous forms in Kianda. From simple feedback forms to GDPR data requests that hope between multi divisions before sending back a response to the requester with the level of information held by the organization.\nAnonymous forms can be embedded in iframes and safely displayed within other web-based applications.\nIn Kianda there are effectively 2 types of anonymous forms\nNew process anonymous form Existing process anonymous form New instance anonymous form URL To set up a globally available link for allowing external users to create a new instance, perform the following steps within the form designer:\nOn the top right corner of the designer click on the settings button. Then click the option “Enable anonymous sharing of forms” to Yes. Click the button “New Link” to generate a new anonymous link. Existing instance anonymous form URL To setup existing instance anonymous form one needs to use the anonymous form rule to generate a new anonymous link at the runtime that will point to an existing process record that can then be shared with external users.\nNote that for this to work steps 1 and 2 of New Instance Anonymous form is still required.\nThe following are some of the key options of the anonymous link rule:\nForm to share (any form within an existing process). Link expires settings: Number of uses, time-based or never expire. Message to display on submission. Important: There can be only one active link of each type for a given process. Once a new anonymous link is created for a process it will automatically expire the previous of the same type if a link existed.\nInput fields Kianda forms usability is brought to life with the help of the various input fields available that are specifically adapted to work in mobile, tablet or desktop modes.\nFrom the textbox, date picker, numeric input, file upload and table, Kianda offers a flexible array of controls that can be adjusted to work with a myriad of scenarios.\nKey properties of fields:\nEach field comes with its own set of settings like autofill for textbox and currency format for numeric input.\nThe following are some of the common settings of input fields:\nTitle - Every field comes with a title property that is usually displayed on top of the field and can serve as a prompt to a user. Required - This Boolean property allows making a field mandatory or not. Visible - Displays the field in the form or not. Layout - Defines both desktop or mobile layout. Cascading dropdown The List field provides the opportunity to define an unlimited level cascading dropdown hierarchy very easily.\nTo achieve that you might connect your list to a data source table or SharePoint list then use the list data source conditions options to filter its content based on a parent list.\nHow to create cascading dropdowns\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Input validation Validating input in forms is quick and easy. Simply enable the required flag of an input field and it will automatically prevent users from submitting it empty.\nThe required flag will conveniently be ignored in case the field is not visible, this will allow you to configure conditionally mandatory fields.\nAnother way of validating input is to use the validate input rule this allows greater flexibility in terms of when or what to validate.\nCloning In the form designer, almost any of the components can be cloned. This will increase your productivity considerably and will make creating multi-step processes a breeze.\nTo clone either a field a panel or even a form simple select the component then click the clone button in the properties panel in the right-hand side of the panel.\nIf cloning a field the cloning dialog will prompt for the destination of the new cloned field, once your choice is made, simply click ok.\nCloning a form\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Custom fields Custom fields section provides access to fields that are built for extensibility of Kianda capabilities. It is particularly useful in those situations where existing fields or rules will not provide the required functionality.\nCustom fields have the purpose of providing a user interface for end-users. If you need to build “an action” then you should use a custom rule widget.\nIt allows a developer to build a reusable component that would then be used by process designers in real processes.\nCheck-out the development section for more details on how to build custom widgets in Kianda.\nAdvanced techniques Like the cascading dropdown discussed above, several other advanced scenarios can be easily configured in Kianda. Here is a short-list:\nRepeating section - A repeating section can be created by adding a panel to a table field. This table can be configured to include a single column made of the panel that itself will include the repeating fields of your repeating section. The capture of media - Kianda enables mobile users to directly capture pictures, video or audio just like a native application. Background save - By making use of PWA principles (Progressive Web Application) Kianda allows the ability to perform background operations. This is useful when, for example, a mobile user picks-up their phone to perform a quick action and places it back in his pocket. Operations will continue in the background allowing all data to be captured. Image annotation - Kianda allows for image annotation online or offline. Multi-column / row layout - Making multi-column responsive interfaces is quite easy. Simply add two panels into a form that only use half of the screen (6 columns) then add fields inside panels and you have multiple column layouts. Adding a panel using 12 columns gives you a row. Form tab colour and icon - Form tabs can be quickly customised to display their icons or tab colours, it is also possible to define custom colours for selected and completed form tabs. Hide form tab and left nav - This is self-explanatory, yes you can hide the default navigation elements.

Publishing involves three main steps: Deploying the process, Tracking dashboards and Launch.\nPublish process\nDeploy the process When you have tested your process prototype using the previewer then you are ready to publish your process to selected test users. It is prudent to have a limited deployment initially making the process available to stakeholders and testers to review. This limited group should include users with various levels of technical skill.\nBefore publishing, make sure you save your work. Go to the Side menu \u003e Administration \u003e Designer \u003e click on the process name.\nClick on the Save button in the left-hand pane. Note that the Version of the process is available in the right-hand pane, where the current version is always visible.\nSaving a process\nWhen you are ready to Publish, click on the Publish button.\nFill out the Publish process dialog box by adding comments. Choose from ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to bulk update process instances.\nPublishing a process\nIf you choose ‘No’ then the latest version is saved and published. If you choose ‘Yes’ then process instances will be updated with the latest design version. Two further questions are prompted:\nTrigger field rules after design update? Options are ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. If you choose ‘Yes’ then you can set a rule or rules to be executed after the design is updated, which will also update the existing instances of the process. Update all instances? Options are ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. If you choose ‘Yes’ this results in an update of the process and applies those changes to all existing instances of the process. Click on OK when complete.\nOnce users have access to your process, it is useful to build one or more dashboards and monitor and track dashboards so you can monitor process data in real time and use this to further modify the process before full deployment.\nTrack dashboards Process dashboards provide real-time metrics to help guide decisions and make improvements in the organisation.\nThe video below introduces dashboards, and the steps in How to build a dashboard run through the the creating process in steps.\nDashboards Your browser does not support the video tag. How to build a dashboard Go to the Side bar \u003e Home and then click on Create a new page button in the Quick Action menu.\nCreate new page button in the Quick Action menu\nFill out the Create dashboard page dialog box. Fill out the Title, the Name that is a Unique ID that autofills from the Title, decide on other parameters like groups that you would like to share to. Click on OK when complete.\nCreate dashboard page\nThe result is a menu of 7 widgets that you can add to your dashboard page. Go to Dashboards to find out more. For the moment we are going to add one widget, a list widget. Click on List widget.\nDashboard widgets\nFill out the Add widget dialog box. Choose a Title, layout size, colour scheme, and decide who the widget is visible to along with device visibility, that is when dashboards will be visible, for example during flight mode.\nAdd widget dialog box\nClick on OK when complete.\nConfigure or edit the widget by clicking on the Pen icon for the widget.\nEditing a widget\nNote: It it possible to add more widgets or edit/configure widgets when you are in Edit mode. To return to View mode, click on the Save button in the Quick Action menu. To return to Edit mode again, click on the Edit current page button in the Quick Action Menu.\nThere are a number of options to choose from in the Edit List dialog box. For now we are going to concentrate on two things: a) connecting to a business process b) choosing certain fields to view in our list.\nClick on Business Process in the left-hand pane and select the process you want to link to, in this case Training Process.\nConnecting to a business process and fields\nIn the right-hand pane, click on Common fields and/or Design fields and select the fields that you want to show in your list widget, in this example the fields Employee Name, Type of Training and Management Decision are chosen from the Design fields. Click on OK when complete.\nThe result is a dashboard that shows instances of Training Requests submitted, and that status of each instance.\nList widget example\nIn this example if the entire process has been completed, the status is ‘Completed’ or if status says ‘Training Approval’ this means this form still needs to be completed. A dashboard like this can highlight bottlenecks in the organisation.\nYou can change the layout of the widget by clicking on the Settings (cog) button .\nFor example if you click on the bar for Layout columns you can increase the width of the widget and see the change in size in real-time in the background.\nWhen you are happy with your changes, click on the Save button in the top menu bar.\nWhen you are in view mode, you can kick off processes from the dashboard widget. Click on the Start new process button and select the process you want to use, in this example the Training Process.\nStart new process\nYou are then brought to the first form in the process, Training Request to kick off the Training Process. As forms are completed, the data in the dashboard is updated in real time.\nThere are endless possibilities with dashboards, the steps above are designed to highlight one particular scenario.\nExample of a dashboard page with different widgets\nConfigured dashboard pages can be shared with your selected users. Allow time for review and get feedback to incorporate into the iterative design process.\nWhen all feedback has been received, updates implemented, and a final quality review conducted successfully, then you are ready to launch!\nLaunch Launching your process involves making your process widely available, that is full deployment for the full user base. Ensure that you have communication, training and support resources in place as part of the launch to aid user adoption.\nIt is also important to make sure you document the development process so that this information can be used as a source of input for future updates.\nWhat’s next If you would like to see examples of ‘how to’ perform particular tasks in Kianda, click on the link below:\nShort “how to” videos To return to the previous pages click on the links below What is low-code development What is no-code development Create your first Kianda process Connect your data Preview the design ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"When you have designed and built your process(es), you are ready to …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/publish-your-process/","tags":"","title":"Publish your process"},{"body":"Introduction Access to the B2B Portal is controlled through standard user and group creation, dashboard security and through how the Shared Processes and Dashboards are defined.\nWhen to use B2B Portals are a means of connecting your clients to your Kianda subscription through their own subscription. This provides a means of allowing your clients to interface with processes you have already created, be it through updating existing processes, deleting processes or creating processes. Access to the B2B Portal can be controlled by your own administrator and each B2B portal can have multiple users for your clients.\nHow to get started To share data with B2B portal users, there are a number of steps involved starting with:\na) Creating users and groups\nb) Create dashboards to share\nc) Create shared processes and attach dashboards to share\nThese steps are covered within the headings below. In addition you can manage data access at a datasource level, click on the link to see more details.\nCreate users and groups for the B2B portal To begin create Users and Groups for the B2B portal. If you are an administrator, navigate to the Administration section in the left-hand side menu and click on Users.\nWithin this page you will be able to view all existing Users and Groups in the portal. In the left-hand side, under Users you can see user names, emails, role and if they are active or not. All existing Groups can be seen in the right-hand side of the screen. Here you can see group names and the number of members.\nFor full details on how to create, edit and delete users and groups got to Users.\nCreate dashboards to share Within your own portal you may then wish to create Dashboards to share. Dashboards provide a convenient way to gain insights into how your business processes are performing. They offer easy reporting, permissions management, quick build, condition-based filtering amongst other features. For details on how to get started with dashboards go to Dashboards. Create shared processes and attach dashboards to share When the dashboard that you want to share within your B2B portal has been created, then you can control access by two means: a) Using the Shared Processes feature within Invite partner within Administration and b) within the B2B portal itself.\nTo implement a) go to Administration \u003e Invite partner and within the Shared processes section, click on Share a process.\nType in a Title and Instructions for partner, click on the plus symbol to add a selected process design to share.\nThen click on the dropdown list to search for a process to share.\nClick on the tick symbol to add the selected shared process.\nClick on the Add partner group button to add a group from step 3 and click on Dashboard template to add the desired Dashboard (from step 4) to share. Security can be set on this dashboard so that only a defined group can see the dashboard - click on the field under Dashboard security to add in a named ‘partner group’ to enable access to this group only.\nAdd as many shared dashboards and partner groups as needed using the previous instructions. In addition the level of access for each shared process can be controlled through system settings. Click on the on the tick symbol to change the shared processes details, and then click on the Cog/Settings button and edit the details within the Process properties dialog box, for example as shown for a Training Request process below.\nWithin the Process properties dialog box you can check radio buttons for:\nAllow partner to create a new process instance - choose from Yes or No. If you choose Yes, then you are allowing invited partner(s) to create new process instances from the chosen shared process design. A field Partner user group allowed to create new instances appears, where you can define the group(s) in the partner organisation, that can create these new process instances. If you leave the field blank, then anyone in the partner organisation can create process instances. Allow partner delete a process instance - choose from Yes or No. If you choose Yes, then you are allowing invited partner(s) to delete new process instances from the chosen shared process design. Partner user group allowed to create new instances- choose from the Partner user groups that you created previously. By selecting a group here this dictates who can enter the process. Thus, defining a sub set of your B2B Portal users which can interact with that specific process. Partner process form visibility mode - choose from Assigned or All forms. If you choose Assigned, then the invited partner(s) can view only assigned form versus all forms, if All forms is chosen. When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on OK, or else click on Close to exit the dialog box at any stage.\nData access at a datasource level When a process is shared within the B2B portal, you may choose to include one or more of your datasources. You may not wish to share all records from the datasource within the B2B portal, so you can limit access within the datasource itself. B2B Security can be enabled with the following datasources:\nActive Directory Docusign Dropbox Email File system FTP Global Payments Google Drive MySQL Office 365 Oracle PowerShell REST Service Salesforce SAP SharePoint SQL Server SOAP Service Go to Administration \u003e Data sources.\nFrom the Datasource management main view, click on a data source that has already been created with a status of ready, by clicking on the name of the data source, or create a new Data source by clicking on Add new, see Data sources for more details.\nIn the Data source details screen, click on the Security button .\nIn the Security settings dialog box, complete the fields as shown on screen, starting with Connection administrators.\nConnection administrators - only users or groups listed here are allowed to modify the connection settings. Click on the dropdown list to choose Users and/or Groups. If you leave the field blank, all Administrators and those users with the Manage datasources role can edit the connection.\nComplete the field for Connection users. Only users or groups listed here are allowed to query data using this connection. Click on the dropdown list to choose Users and/or Groups. If you leave the field blank, any user can query data within the datasource.\nCheck/Uncheck Enable B2B. If you check the checkbox, this allows B2B external users to query the connection. The Enable partner default query parameters checkbox appears.\nCheck/Uncheck Enable partner default query parameters. If you check the checkbox, you can define default query parameters that are applied to any partner originated query. Parameters defined here take precedence over any design time queries. Click on Add mapping to choose a query type and table/operation as follows:\nQuery type - choose from Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). These CRUD operations allow you to create, read, update and delete records within your datasource.\nTable/Operation - click on Select a table to select a resource within the data connector. Click on OK when you are finished editing, or Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\nQuery parameters - when a datasource resource is chosen, for example a SharePoint list called ‘Countries’ below, then you will have an option to set conditions for filtering data.\nClick on Filter conditions to open an Edit conditions dialog box and from there click on Add a conditions group.\nIf you choose to set conditions using the steps above, then in the Edit conditions dialog box, you can set conditions based on data source parameters, operators and form fields.\nThe parameter on the left comes from the data source, for example for SharePoint, there are 18 possible values listed in SharePoint parameters. See Data sources for information about other data connectors. Within this dialog box you can also use different operators, for example Equals as shown above. See Conditions for more details on using conditions in Kianda.\nThe right-most field relates to the B2B Portal and B2B User. There are standard options listed below:\nMain Contact Name – the first name and last name of the Partner Main Contact Email – the email of the Partner Partner Company Name – the Partner organisation of the Partner Partner Current User Name – the user within the B2B Portal that is accessing the datasource Partner Current User Email – the user’s email within the B2B Portal that is accessing the datasource When you have added conditions click on OK, or click on Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\nWhen you are finished editing the security settings dialog box, click on OK, or click on Close at any time to exit the dialog box.\nWhat’s next To read more about User and group management, go to Users.\nTo read more about Dashboards, go to Dashboards.\nTo read more about Conditions, go to Conditions.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction Access to the B2B Portal is controlled through standard …","ref":"/docs/platform/b2b-portals/data-access/","tags":"","title":"Secure Data Access"},{"body":"Introduction Success/Error mapping is used to denote the success or failure of certain rules being executed where data is being transferred or a rule is connected to a data connector.

A custom widget could be a ‘Field’, ‘Rule’ or ‘Dashboard widget’. This video goes through an example of how to create a custom field widget.\nCreating a custom field widget\nYour browser does not support the video tag. To create custom widgets:\nGo to the Side menu \u003e Administration \u003e Developer\nClick on New widget.\nFill out the Edit widget dialog box - that is Title, Unique Id (which is autofilled from the title), Widget Icon, where you can select from hundreds of icons, and then Widget type. There are 3 options: Field, Rule or Dashboard widget - click on each link for more details.\nClick on OK when complete.\nWidgets created are visible in the main widget view. From here, you can edit a widget by clicking on the Edit button (Pen icon), delete a widget by clicking on the Bin/Trash button and restore earlier versions of a widget by clicking on the Version restore button .\nWidget view\nWebhooks can be created to send a message to a specific URL by clicking on the Webhooks button.

ProcessLink() is a function that will return a link to that process instance. Using these expressions in an email will mean that every time an instance of the process runs, the values will be presented in an automated email, creating greater efficiencies and personalising the email for the recipient.\nOne of the most commonly used rules that uses expressions is the Communications rule, Send email - we will use this as an example in the video and in the Getting started section below.\nUsing expressions: Example of Sending email\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Getting started with expressions Expressions are recognisable in Kianda from the Expressions button found in edit rule dialog boxes and other menu items, such as enabling quick actions for processes.\nWithin rules, expressions can be created using the Expression builder where you can select Add field to an expression or use the handy Reference guide to get a list of commonly used functions.\nExpression builder\nNow let’s go step by step through the process of adding an expression to the Body of an email that is being sent using the Send email rule. To create an expression:\nSelect a form or forms, field or fields and then, a rule, for example Send email, as found in the left side menu \u003e Add a rule \u003e Communications\u003e Send email. Under Action, click on the Expressions button beside Body. Click on the field under Add field to expression and find the field you want to reference in your email - for example, a text box titled EmployeeName. Click Add to expression. Click OK. To add additional field expressions, click on the Expressions button again, under Add field to expression, click on X beside the field name to clear the expression box and then search for the desired field from a form. To add a function, click on Reference and copy the function into the body of the email. A list of expression functions are available here: (+, -, /, *) operations - Perform basic math operations Sum(arg1, arg2, …) - Returns the sum of the provided arguments Date(arg1) - Converts the argument into a date DateAdd(dateArg, day, month, year, hour, min) - Adds time to a date. The arguments day, month, year, hour and min represent the number to add for each respective argument Status() - Returns the process status ProcessID() - Returns the process ID FormOwner(‘formName’) - Returns form owners for a given form FormCompleted(‘formName’) - Returns form completed date for a given form Pad(value, size, symbol) - Adds left padding to the value with the symbol provided QueryString(‘parameter’) - Returns the URL query parameter or empty string if undefined IsOnline() - Returns “yes” or “no” if the current has connectivity or not ProcessLink() - Returns the html link to the current process. For use in emails or rich text fields. Digest() - Returns the summary of field changes of a process Digest(’*fieldName1*’,’*fieldName2*’) - Returns the summary of field changes for the selected fields GetFieldText(’*fieldName*’) - Returns the field text GetFieldValue(’*fieldName*’) - Returns the field value Click on OK when complete.

Number fields can be formatted to be integers (whole numbers), currency or percentages.\nFor example, in a Purchase Order Request form, you may want to use Number fields to allow the user to insert the number, unit price and total cost of items being ordered and you may apply rules to some of those fields so that they perform calculations or pull values from other fields or forms. Go to Rules and Expression builder for more information on how you make your forms dynamic.\nHow to get started To add a Number field to a form, first open the relevant process.\nThen select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible).\nClick on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\nSelect Input to view the range of Input controls and click on Number.\nA number field will be added to your form with the default title of ‘’Number 1’’ and a pop-up message will say ‘Field added’.\nBy default, the new Number field will have up and down arrow buttons at the right that users can click to increase or decrease the number in the field and will show any numbers entered to two decimal places. These settings can be amended by editing the field.\nIn the example shown here, a new Number field has been added to form called ‘Training Request’. This new Number field could be edited to rename it ‘Cost of Training Course’ and could be formatted as currency (Euro) so that users could insert the cost of the training course they want to take.\nHow to edit, move and delete Number fields To edit a Number field:\nSelect the field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s Drag handle button )\nClick on the Edit field button (Pen icon) .\nThe Edit field - Number dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from a range of options:\nThe options within the Edit field - Number dialog box include:\nTitle - you can change the title of the Number field from the default ‘Number 1’\nHelp text - you can insert text to help the form user to complete the Number field. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\nDisplay format - you can choose whether the number inserted by the user is formatted to be an integer (whole number), currency or a percentage.\nIf you select Currency as the Display format, a new option will appear - Currency format - where you can select the currency you want to use.\nIf you select Euro as the Currency format, a new format option called Country format appears to the right.

These rules enable you to execute actions that can change the flow of information within a process. There are 7 workflow rules, see Workflow for more information. Communications - rules associated with user communication for example sending an email, meeting request or triggering a user alert. There are 4 communication rules, see Communications for more information. Data - rules associated with database operations Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) allowing these actions to occur on configured data sources. There are 5 data rules, see Data for more information. Users - rules associated with user properties, allowing user lookup based on a user attribute or retrieve a user property. There are 4 user rules, see Users for more information. File management - rules concerned with generating documents such as Word, Excel or converting to PDF. There are 7 file management rules, see File Management for more information. Tables - rules associated with table operations such as sorting, copying table rows to another table, adding and removing table rows. There are 12 table rules, see Tables for more information. Dates - date rules to calculate time and format dates with advanced filter options like omitting weekends or special dates . There are 4 date rules, see Dates for more information. Form actions - rules linked to actions that are part of forms, for example submit, close or save. There are 6 form rules, see Form actions for more information. SharePoint - SharePoint associated rules such as adding, finding or removing users, defining permissions and check-in/checkout of an item. There are 10 SharePoint rules, see SharePoint for more information. KiandaAI - there is 1 KiandaAI rule related to text analysis, see KiandaAI for more information. Rule design Click on an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer and decide which form or field you will apply the rule to, by clicking on that item so that it is in edit mode so you can see the Pen button, Pen button for example a form Training Approval or Submit button.\nClick on Add a rule in the right-hand pane and click on a category of choice, such as Communications and then a rule User alert.\nRule order If there is more than 1 rule for an item like a field or button, then the order of execution must be considered.\nFor example for a Submit button on a form I may want my Send email rule to be executed first before any other rule is executed. To do this click on the Submit button to make sure you are in Edit mode, and under Rules in the right-hand pane, drag the Send email rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and dragging it to the top.\nGo to [Multiple rules](/docs/platform/rules/general/multiple-rules/) to read more about using mutiple rules on a field or other item.

We place security at the core of our offering.\nIn terms of security and quality, Kianda’s services and solutions are ISO27001:2013 certified and audited by external parties, so you can be confident that we follow best practice for our clients’ data and information security.\nThe Kianda Platform is a solution that is SaaS cloud-based, and allows for integration to multiple third-party IT systems or siloed data sources. For example, SharePoint Online Environment and Active Directory, SAP, SQL Server, O365 and Oracle.\nQuality Assurance To ensure Kianda meets the highest quality assurance levels, we employ a number of methodologies, including:\nKianda is ISO 27001 ISMS certified and audited by an external party every 6 months. Details can be accessed here: https://www.kianda.com/information-security. Kianda follows agile methodologies for managing product development and project deliveries. Team members are certified in Agile Project Management and Scrum Framework, ensuring we deliver best practice project documentation and product development cycles. Kianda’s Information Security Management System (ISMS) policy is designed to protect Kianda’s information assets as well our clients’ information from all threats (whether internal or external, deliberate or accidental), to provide a security approach that satisfies our clients, and to ensure a solid understanding of security requirements and risk management practices and effective communication of security to all Kianda employees, contractors, partners, clients and third parties. Kianda’s Information Security Policy ‘Security in Development and Support Processes’ covers Patch Management Processes, Technical Review of Operating System Changes Restrictions on Changes to Software Packages and Product Development stages. Kianda regularly backs-up adequate copies and generations of all software, documentation and business information. Regular testing is carried out to ensure the quality and usability of backed-up resources. The Kianda Platform fully complies with General Data Protection Requirements (GDPR) and is being continually improved, with an enhancement roadmap in place.\nSecurity and Authentication The Kianda platform provides Single Sign On (SSO) capability with SharePoint or OneLogin. This allows users to create, view and approve forms by first logging in with their Active Directory (AD) account.\nSecurity is provided by integration with the Clients Active Directory / O365 or other Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requirements. It can synchronise users and their groups from SharePoint, O365 or AD. The platform provides the ability for external users to integrate with SSO and MFA authentication via guest users in O365.\nKianda can be linked with active directory groups set up by the client to control permissions. The system can synchronize with the existing permissions from AD.\nUser Management The Kianda platform allows for different users to have different security privileges, providing for easy administrative management of users and their access rights. Our platform allows the following user levels by default:\nUser - can only access what is assigned to them. For example, forms and dashboards Administrator - can access (view and edit) all Manage partners/customers - can only access what is required to manage customer portals Design business process - can only design business forms and workflows Manage data sources - can only manage data sources and connections Developer - can design new widgets within the platform The platform allows for the creation of user groups and the ability to assign these user groups to processes or dashboards as needed. Dashboard levels or particular widgets can be configured to only be visible to certain users or groups of users and data source connections can be configured in the same way to ensure the highest access control levels.\nOur data classification system has been designed to support access to information based on the need to know, so that information will be protected from unauthorised disclosure, use, modification and deletion.\nThe Kianda platform ensures that data is never transmitted in clear text or stored in a database or file solution. The platform is hosted in MS Azure with enterprise-grade security. All data generated is encrypted at rest and in transit. Data records are also masked from a GDPR point of view. We employ Microsoft security products to automatically mask and classify personal data - which is scheduled weekly.\nOverall, Kianda Technologies follows ISO ISMS policies, GDPR best practices and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) guidelines for product development. Kianda Technologies will also adhere to Client security standards.\nEase of use The Kianda Platform offers administrative interfaces that are private and segregated from user interfaces.\nKianda forms, by default, provide edit and reassign functions that are only available to admin users or configurable roles within the system. These quick actions allow admin users to make changes to an existing form record when needed. Any changes made by any user are logged in the Audit History.\nIn terms of designing new forms or making changes to existing designs, admin users have the ability to preview their changes before publishing within the design interface. Changes only become visible to end-users after the process or form has been published. In addition, live and test environments are provided to enterprise clients, providing the ability to test in the test environment before publishing to live.\nFor further ease of use, error messages are configurable within the Kianda platform. They can be created freely when forms are being designed to ensure scenarios such as data validation or indicating the next course of action. This gives flexibility to form designers to define error messages as needed.\nIt is easy to learn how to optimally use the Kianda platform. Kianda training is delivered by technical experts and trainers with a deep understanding of the platform, ensuring that clients’ training experience is optimised. Projects are structured so that clients’ appointed staff are involved during the whole journey of project execution. This facilitates knowledge transfer and an “on-the-job” training approach and includes specific training sessions that are run before and after solution delivery.\nDashboards and reporting The Kianda platform allows admin users to personalise dashboards based on the unique needs of users or user groups based on hierarchy - for example, only project managers see their forms status and admin users may see the full picture.\nMultiple dashboards can be created and customised as required per project, per department or other configurations. Access to the dashboards can be set at a high level for the entire dashboard or certain links, lists or widgets in a dashboard and can be made accessible to certain user groups defined in the system.\nDashboard page\nExamples of some of our dashboard features include:\nNumber of forms awaiting approval Number of completed forms per week/period/quarter Split dashboards by type or department Columns to cater for “requested by”, “date of request”, “pending approval from”, “approved by”, “rejected by” An alerts section to highlight approvals that have been pending past X number of days Designing layouts to group certain fields Charts, Lists, Links, Tiles and Rich Text are available dashboard widgets The Kianda platform allows users to report on different forms within a SharePoint site (or other relevant data source), as well as for a particular form library. In addition, the platform allows reporting across multiple form libraries, SharePoint Sites, and SharePoint Site Collections. Our reporting capability goes way beyond reporting from SharePoint data, and allows combining of data from multiple data sources for reporting purposes.\nAudit history Kianda logs and makes available all security-related events within the Audit History of each record to administrative users. Also, system logs can be made available when required.\nBy default, all the forms and processes created in our platform come with detailed read-only Audit History. Audit logs are created for any modifications made to records automatically and are only available to configured roles to view. Our platform allows for the set-up of an “auditor role”, with read-only access, to allow an auditor to run reports and check audit logs.\nAdmin users can configure optional record level viewing logs. The recording of audit logs is automatic for any changes in the forms which gives detailed field-level auditing information.\nThe Kianda Platform integrates with SharePoint which provides IRM (Information Rights Management) features that enable the tagging of certain data or documents not to be printed or emailed and so on.\nSupport and security updates Within the Kianda platform, administrative users and general users can report any queries or issues using the support ticket menu option available. Our platform is updated with one major release per year and patch/security releases multiple times during the year (which includes security updates). These are communicated with clients in advance.\nWe provide multi-levels of data recovery. This includes data version history of records, recycle bin feature and ability to recover from a point in time, backups with a time window of every 10 minutes.\nOur platform supports 99% uptime. We provide 99% availability; availability is calculated with the exception of scheduled maintenance.\nOur services are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, excluding planned downtime. We expect planned downtime to be infrequent but will endeavour to provide customers with advance notice. If our systems fail, we treat this as a critical high priority event with an impact on our business continuity. We will do everything possible to solve the issue as soon as possible. Our web services use highly available services with geo-redundancy enabling a failover to another European region in the event of emergency.\nWhat’s next If you want to use Kianda for no-code development, follow these simple steps:\nPlan your process\nDesign and build your process\nPublish your process\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"\nKianda is committed to delivering a best-in-class solution to our …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/welcome/security/","tags":"","title":"Security"},{"body":"Table controls (fields) can be inserted in a form if you want form users to complete a table, if you want display data pulled from external sources in a table, or if you want a table to be autofilled as part of a rule. Tables can include different types of fields, such as text boxes, date fields, number fields, and list fields.\nFor example, in a Purchase Order Request form, you may want to use a Table field to display certain information about items or suppliers and/or to capture details the user inputs about items being ordered. In addition, you could apply rules to some of the fields within the table to, for example, automatically calculate totals or percentages or to pull in data from external data sources.\nFor more information about applying rules to fields and forms go to Rules and for more specific information about applying rules to Table fields see Table rules.\nWe will now go through\nhow to add a Table field to a form how to edit column fields in a Table how to change the title of a Table colulmn how to delete a column from a Table how to change the field type of an existing Table column how to insert new columns in a Table how to move columns in a Table how to edit the Table field how to move Table fields how to delete Table fields how to edit Table field properties How to get started To add a Table field to a form, first open the relevant process.\nThen select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible).\nClick on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\nSelect Input to view the range of Input controls and click on Table.\nA Table field will be added to your form with the default title of ‘’Table 1’’ and a pop-up message will say ‘Field added’.\nBy default, the new Table field will have one row with two columns of text fields, titled Text 1 and Text 2. You can add rows, columns and various different types of fields to the table by editing the table field, as outlined in the next section. In the example shown here, a new table has been added to a form called ‘Training Request’.\nHow to edit, move and delete Table fields As we go through the options available for editing a Table, we will keep in mind the example of the table we added to the ‘Training Request’ form above.\nHow to edit column fields in a Table First, decide how many columns you need in your table and what type of input field you want to use for each column. To learn more about the eight different types of Input fields that you can use, go to Input controls.\nIn our example, we want to change the default table that was inserted - titled Table 1 with two columns of text box fields - into a table called ‘Existing Qualifications’ to capture the existing qualifications of the user who is requesting further training.\nWe want our table to have three columns: the first column will be a text box field titled ‘Qualification Description’ where the user will manually type in the name of a qualification, the second column will be a drop-down list titled ‘Educational Institution’ (which could link to an external data source) where the user will choose the relevant institution, and the third column will be a date field titled ‘Date Qualification Obtained’, as shown here:\nHow to change the title of a Table column To change the default title of the first column texbox field from Text 1:\nSelect that field by either clicking on the field title or by clicking into the blank text box so that the Edit field button (Pen icon) displays. Click the Edit field button. The Edit field - Text dialog box will open and you can change the title of the field here. There are also a number of other options available to you - see Text box control for more information on how you can edit text box fields.\nHow to delete a column from a Table To delete a column from a Table field:\nSelect the column field you want to delete (either by clicking on the title or clicking into the blank field below the title) so that the Edit field and Bin/Trash button is shown. Click on the Bin/Trash button. How to change the field type of an existing Table column In our example, we want the second column in our table to be a drop-down list. We can either delete the default second text box column and then insert a new list column or we can change the field type of the existing column from text box to list.\nTo change the field type of an existing column:\nSelect the column field you want to change (by either clicking on the column Title or clicking into the blank box below it) so that the Edit field button (Pen icon) is shown.\nClick on the Change field button in the right-hand pane:\nA Change dialog box will open up, allowing you to change the existing column field type to another type of input field - there are many options to choose from (only some of which are shown here):\nIn our example, if we want to change the ‘Text 2’ text box column to be a List field, we would select the List radio box and then click OK to confirm. An Edit field dialog box for the type of input field you have chosen will then open, allowing you to change the column field title (in our case, we will rename it as ‘Educational Institution’) and to choose from a range of options relevant to that field type.\nHow to insert new columns in a Table To insert new columns into a Table:\nEither select the Table field itself or select one of the individual columns.\nGo to Controls\u003eInput in the menu in the left-hand pane and click on the type of input field you want to insert.\nThe new column will be inserted to the right of the existing columns, or, if you selected one of the existing columns before inserting the new column, it will be inserted to that right of that column.\nIn our example, we will insert a date field to be our third column (and can then rename it as ‘Date Qualification Obtained’ by clicking on Edit field button (Pen icon) and changing it in the Edit field - Date dialog box):\nHow to move columns in a Table To re-order columns in a Table, simply\nSelect the column field you want to move (by either clicking the column title or clicking into the blank box below the title) so the Edit field button (Pen icon) displays. Click on the left or right arrow buttons to move that column to the left or right: How to edit the Table field To edit the Table field itself:\nSelect the Table (by either clicking on the Table title or on the table’s Drag handle button ). Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) . The Edit field - Table dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from a range of options:\nThe options within the Edit field - Table dialog box include:\nTitle - you can change the title of the Table from the default ‘Table 1’. In our example, we could change the name of the table to ‘Existing Qualifications’.\nHelp text - you can insert text to help the form user to complete the Table. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\nAdd row text - you can insert the text you want to appear with the Add Row button . By default, this will be ‘add row’.\nPage size - you can increase or decrease the number of row items you will see per page by clicking the up/down arrow buttons at the right of the field. By default, it is set to show 10 row items per page.\nEnable adding rows - selecting ‘Yes’ enables the user to add rows to the table when they are completing it and displays the Add row button and selecting ‘No’ removes this option. By default, this option is set to ‘Yes’.\nEnable removing rows - selecting ‘Yes’ enables the user to remove rows from the table as they are completing it (by clicking on the Bin/Trash button at the end of each table row) and selecting ‘No’ removes this option. By default, this option is set to ‘Yes’.\nShow row count - you can choose to display text showing the number of rows in the table. This text will appear below the Add row button:\nEnable sorting - you can select ‘Yes’ to enable the form user to sort the data in the table\nEnable search - you can select ‘Yes’ to enable the form user to search the data in the table. If you choose this option, the form user will see a search field at the top of the table:\nAdd first row onload - by default, this is set to ‘Yes’, meaning that when the form is loaded the first row is automatically shown\nEnable export to csv - you can select ‘Yes’ to enable the form user to export the table contents to a csv file. If you select ‘Yes’, some additional options appear in the Edit field - Table dialog box:\nThe CSV Separator is set to be a comma by default (but you can change this) and you can insert text you want to appear on the Export CSV button. For example, if you insert ‘Export to CSV’ as the text to appear on the button, it will appear like this in the form to the user:\nThe Columns to export will automatically show the columns in your table\nMake whatever changes you want to make to the table in the Edit field - Table dialog box and then click OK to confirm. If you want to make your table more dynamic - for example, so that calculations are made or information is autofilled into part of the table - you can add rules to it. To learn about applying rules to fields and forms go to Rules and for more specific information about applying rules to Table fields see Table rules.\nHow to move Table fields To move a Table field within your form:\nSelect the field’s Drag handle button Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to. How to delete Table fields To delete a Table field from your form:\nSelect the field (by either clicking on the field’s name or its Drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button . Click on OK to confirm. How to edit Table field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a Table field, select the table (by clicking on the field title or field drag handle button ) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a Table field titled ‘Existing Qualifications’ are shown here and include:\nField type - The type of field, in this case a Table field. Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Existing Qualifications’. Show title - If this is selected, the Table field title will be shown in the form. Required - If this is selected, the Table field will be mandatory for the form user. Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field. Visible - If this is selected, the Table field will be visible in the form. Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the Table field as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right). You can then check how the Table will appear to users on their PC or mobile phone by first saving your form and then clicking on the Preview button . Our sample table, Existing Qualifications could look like this when viewed on a PC:\nYou can also view and edit the properties of the individual column fields within the Table by selecting the column field.\nTo learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about the Table control, find out more about the other types of Input fields you can add to a Kianda process:\nDate control File upload control List control Number control Text box control Toggle control User picker control ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Table controls (fields) can be inserted in a form if you want form …","ref":"/docs/platform/controls/input/table/","tags":"","title":"Table control"},{"body":"In this section we will cover a variety of use cases in a generic manner to highlight best practice use cases of Kianda features and how they help solve specific requirements.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"In this section we will cover a variety of use cases in a generic …","ref":"/docs/examples/","tags":"","title":"Example Use Cases"},{"body":" Page under construction\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Page under construction\n","ref":"/docs/low-code/global-css-file/","tags":"","title":"Global CSS file"},{"body":"Table rules is one category of rules to enable table operations such as sorting, copying table rows to another table, exporting and importing table data as .csv files and adding and removing table rows.

For example, in a Training Request form, you may want the user to insert their first name and surname and may want those fields to be mandatory for the user to complete.\nThere are various options available when creating a Text box field, such as formatting it to allow multiple lines of text, to contain a password (text input is not shown) or to autofill with saved information such as the user’s address or email. More advanced options include applying a rule or expression to a Text box field - for more information, see Rules and Expression builder.\nHow to get started To add a Text box field to a form, first open the relevant process.\nThen select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible).\nClick on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\nSelect Input to view the range of Input controls and click on Text box.\nA Text box field will be added to your form with the default title of ‘’Text box 1’’ and a pop-up message will say ‘Field added’.\nIn the example shown here, a Text box field has been added to a form called ‘Training Request’ in a process called ‘Training Process’, as the first step in adding two Text box fields (which will be used to capture the first name and surname of the user who is completing the form).\nYou can also place a Text box within an element - such as within a panel in a form. In the example above, the Text box was inserted outside the panel in the form. If you wanted to insert it within the panel, simply select the panel itself by clicking on its drag handle and then click on Controls\u003eInput\u003eText box - this will result in the new Text box being added inside the panel, as shown here:\nHow to edit, move and delete Text box fields As we go through the options available for editing a Text box, we will keep in mind the example of adding two text boxes to the ‘Training Request’ form to capture a user’s first name and surname.\nHow to edit a Text box field To edit a Text box field:\nSelect the Text box (by either clicking on its title or its Drag handle button ). Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) . The Edit field - Text dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from a range of options:\nThe options within the Edit field - Text box dialog box include:\nTitle - you can change the title of the Text box from the default ‘Text box 1’. In our example, we could change the name of the first Text box to ‘First Name’ and the second Text box to ‘Surname’.\nName (unique) - this is a unique name for the Text box field\nHelp text - you can insert text to help the form user to complete the Table. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\nMode - you can decide whether your Text box is limited to a Single line of text or will allow for Multiple lines of text or can choose Rich text. Different additional options will then be shown, depending on the Mode you have chosen.\nIf you choose ‘Single line of text’ as the Mode for your Text box - as in the example shown above - these additional options will be shown:\nMax length - choose the maximum number of characters for the text inserted in your Text box by either typing in a number or by clicking the up/down arrow buttons at the right side of the blank field beneath it\nText style - choose Normal, Capitalise, Uppercase or Lowercase, depending on how you want the text input in the Text box to appear\nControl type - choose either Text or Password. If you choose Password, then the text input by the user in the Text box will not be visible:\nAutofill type - you can choose between Default, Off, Password, Address, Email and Phone. If, for example, you select Address, this means that when the user is completing this Text box field, it will automatically populate with the user’s saved address information (if the user has that saved information on their PC or mobile phone).\nPlaceholder - you can insert placeholder text to appear in the Text box field to assist the user. For example, this Text box field titled ‘Address 1’ has placeholder text:\nIf you choose ‘Multiple lines of text’ as the Mode for your Text box, these additional options will be shown:\nRows - you can decide how many rows of text you want your Text box to have.

They can be used as either a toggle or as a checkbox - for example, Toggle fields could be used to create a series of checkboxes in an Onboarding Form to record whether a new employee has received required training, been assigned an employee number and so on.\nRules can be applied to Toggle fields to make your form more dynamic. One such rule, the Show, hide or disable rule can be applied to a Toggle field to have the effect of showing or hiding remaining options/sections in the form dependent on whether the toggle/checkbox is selected or not.\nFor example, in a Training Request form, a Toggle field could be used to record a manager’s decision to either approve or reject an employee’s training request - by applying the Show, hide or disable rule to this field, a different last section of the form will display based on the manager’s decision. If the manager select’s to approve the training, a sign-off button then appears; if the manager reject’s the request, a ‘Reason’ text box appears for them to insert their feedback. To learn more about applying rules to fields, see Rules and Expression builder. To find out more about this specific rule, go to Show, hide or disable.\nHow to get started To add a Toggle field to a form, first open the relevant process.\nThen select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible). If you want to add the Toggle field to a panel within your form, first select the panel by clicking on it and then add the Toggle field.\nInsert the new Toggle field by clicking on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu, then select Input to view the range of Input controls and click on Toggle.\nA New field - Toggle dialog box will open with a range of options you can choose from for your new Toggle field.\nThe options available in the New field - Toggle dialog box include:\nTitle - You can change the name of the Toggle field from the default title Toggle 1.\nName - This is a unique name for the field.\nHelp text - You can insert text to explain to the form user what selecting the toggle/checkbox means. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted. In this example, the Toggle field is titled ‘Approve Training’ and has associated help text:\nValue when enabled - You can set the value for when the user selects the toggle/checkbox. For example, the value when it is selected could be ‘Yes’.\nValue when disabled - You can set the value for when the user does not select the toggle/checkbox. For example, the value when it is not selected could be ‘No’.\nDisplay mode - You can choose to have the Toggle field display as either a Toggle button or Checkbox .\nOnce you complete the New field - Toggle dialog box and click OK button, a new Toggle field is added to your form, with the name you inserted as the Title in the dialog box (by default, the title is Toggle 1 unless you change it).\nIf we take the example of the Training Request form we already discussed, with a Toggle field called ‘Approve Training Request’ that is formatted to be a checkbox, the Toggle field could look like this when a user views it on their mobile phone:\nTo check how your form or field will look like on a mobile, view it in Mobile preview by clicking the Preview button (play icon) after first saving your changes.\nHow to edit, move and delete Toggle fields As we go through the options available for editing a Toggle field, we will keep in mind the example of the ‘Approve Training Request’ Toggle field in our Training Request form.\nHow to edit a Toggle field To edit a Toggle field:\nSelect the field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s Drag handle button ) Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) The Edit field - Toggle dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - Toggle dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).\nYou can make any changes you wish in this dialog box and then click OK to confirm. You can apply rules to a Toggle field to make it more dynamic so that, for example, it generates information that is automatically inserted into another field.\nFor example, you could apply a ‘Set date’ rule to your ‘’Order Received’ toggle field so that it generates a date to be displayed in a ‘Date received’ field when Order received is selected by the user - this will mean that when the user selects the Order Received toggle field, this automatically generates a date stamp for when the order was received:\nTo learn more about applying rules to fields, see Rules and Expression builder. To find out more about the specific rule added in our example - where a date is automatically populated in another field - go to Set form field.\nHow to move a Toggle field To move a Toggle field:\nSimply select the field’s Drag handle button Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to within your form How to delete a Toggle field To delete a Toggle field from your form:\nSelect the field (by either clicking on the field’s name or its Drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button Click on OK to confirm.

Often, rules are applied to buttons so that actions are automatically executed once the user clicks on the button. In this way, Button fields with rules can be used to trigger a sequence of events. To learn more about rules, go to Rules.\nFor example, as part of an Employee Appraisal Process, a manager may complete a Performance Plan form for each employee, setting out their Key Performance Areas and goals. It could be useful to add a button to this form - titled ‘Schedule Meeting’ - that will automatically schedule a performance review meeting between the manager and the employee at a pre-determined date in the future. We will keep this example in mind as we learn more about using Button controls.\nHow to get started To add a Button field to a Kianda form:\nOpen an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer in the left side menu and clicking on a process, or create a new process in Designer. See Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.\nOnce you have opened your process, select the form you want to work on (so that the Edit Form button is shown).\nIn this example, a Performance Plan form has been selected:\nSelect the area within the form where you want to insert the new Button field - in our example, we will select the panel containing the ‘Schedule performance plan review meeting’ information.\nClick on Controls in the left-hand pane, and, from the four categories of Controls (Input, Layout, Actions and Custom), click on Actions.\nSelect Button from the four types of Action fields: Button, Link, Image and Signature:\nA New field - Button dialog box will automatically open, giving you options for your new Button field:\nThe options available in the New field - Button dialog box include:\nTitle - You can change the name of the Button from the default ‘Button 1’.\nName (Unique) - This is a unique name for the new field.\nHelp text - You can insert text to help the form user. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\nColor scheme - You can choose a colour for your new Button field from six options.\nIcon - You can choose an icon to appear on your Button by clicking on the down arrow to the right and scrolling to select the icon you want to use (or can opt not to add an icon).\nShow in form body - Select Yes if you want your Button to be shown in the Form.\nEnable button security - Select Yes if you want to limit who can see the Button you are adding to the form.\nIf you select Yes, two additional options are displayed: Add security and Allow anonymous link.\nWhen you click on Add security, a new line appears with the options Field security and Select user(s) or groups:\nIn Field security, you can choose from three options in terms of who will be able to view the Button you are inserting:\n(i) If you choose to limit the Button visibility to a ‘User or group’, you can then select the user(s) or groups you want to be able to see the Button in the ‘Select user(s) or groups’ box.\n(ii) If you choose to limit the Button visibility to a ‘User picker field’, you then select the User picker field in the ‘Select a userpicker field’ box:\nThis will limit the visibility of the Button to the user(s) selected in that User picker field.\n(iii) If you choose to limit the Button visibility to ‘Form owner(s)’, you then select the form in the ‘Select a form’ box - only the owner(s) of the selected form will be able to view the new Button you are inserting:\nThe second main option in terms of Button security is ‘Allow anonymous link’:\nIf you choose Yes, this will mean that the Button field will be visible when the form is accessed via an anonymous link.\nIf you choose No, anyone accessing the form from an anonymous link will not be able to see the Button field.\nAnonymous links can be useful if, for example, you want members of the public to complete your form without needing to log into Kianda. To learn more about how you can create anonymous links to a form that can be shared with external users, see Anonymous form link.\nOnce you complete the New field - Button dialog box, click OK and the new Button field is added to your form.\nIn our example, if we changed the Button field title to ‘Schedule Meeting’ and chose a green colour scheme and ‘people’ icon, our new Button could look like this when added to our ‘Performance Plan’ form:\nYou may then decide to add rules to your new Button field - to learn more, go to Rules. The rules we add will be executed in the order in which they are listed under Rules in the right hand pane.\nFor example, we could add a series of rules to our new Schedule Meeting button:\nIn our example, the sixth rule is a Meeting Request rule which will mean that, once the Schedule Meeting button is clicked, an automated email will be sent to the employee scheduling a performance review meeting - to learn more, go to Meeting request rule.\nHow to edit, move and delete Button fields To edit a Button field:\nSelect the Button field (by either clicking on the field name or on the field’s drag handle button )\nClick on the Edit Field button (Pen icon) The Edit Field dialog box will open (with the Button title you chose reflected in the dialog box name), enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - Button dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).\nTo move a Button, simply:\nSelect the Button’s Drag handle button Drag and drop the Button wherever you want to move it within your form.\nFor example, the ‘Schedule Meeting’ Button could be moved from where it was automatically added at the bottom of the panel to the location where we want it to go:\nTo delete a Button from your form:\nSelect the Button (by either clicking on the Button’s title or its drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button Click on OK to confirm. How to view and edit Button field properties To view or edit a Button’s Field properties:\nSelect the Button field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s drag handle button ).\nThe Field Properties associated with the Button field will be displayed (and can be changed) in the Field properties menu to the right.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a Button field titled ‘Schedule Meeting’ are shown here and include:\nField type - The type of field, in this case a Button. Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Schedule Meeting’. Show title - If this is selected, the Button field title will be shown in the form. Required - If this is selected, the Button will be mandatory for the form user. Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field. Visible - If this is selected, the Button will be visible in the form. Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the Button as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right). ​\tFor more details, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button .

For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click to the very end of the bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.\nColour scheme - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White), if you choose to display it.\nShow header - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your Custom widget to be shown in the dashboard. In our example, we will de-select the ‘Show header’ option so that the header is not shown.\nVisible to - You can choose who will be able to see the Custom widget. Select single or multiple Users or Groups, or a combination of the two. You can use the menu on the right to either filter the drop-down list by Users or Groups. To find out more about pre-defined Groups on Kianda, go to Users \u0026 Groups.\nNote - Dashboard page security: When a dashboard page is first created, the users(s)/group(s) who will be able to view the dashboard are selected in the ‘Visible to’ option in the Create dashboard page dialog box (see Step 3 in How to create a Dashboard page).\nYou can also edit or update this setting at any point to change who has permission to view a particular dashboard page. This higher dashboard-level security setting will take precedence over the security settings (‘Visible to’) that are applied to the individual widgets within the dashboard (such as a Custom dashboard widget, in this case).\nSee Dashboard security and Widget security for more information.\nLayout container - This option will only display if you have already created layout containers for your Dashboard page. Here, you can select which layout container you want your new Custom widget to be placed in.\nA layout container is a simple way to organise, arrange and move the widgets you add to your dashboard. To learn more about layout containers, go to How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page.\nIn this example, we can select to place our new Custom dashboard widget into one of three layout containers - Top, Middle or Bottom:\nDevice visibility - You can choose what devices and types of internet connections the dashboard Custom widget will be visible on - select all the options you want from Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, Wi-Fi and Flight mode as to when the device can view the dashboards. By default, all options are selected.\nClick on OK when you’ve completed the Add widget dialog box.\nAn Edit widget dialog box automatically opens showing the options you can choose for that particular Custom dashboard widget. The options available will be dependent on the functionality of the custom widget.\nClick on the OK button when you are finished choosing the options you want (or click on Close to exit the Edit widget dialog box without saving).\nYour Custom widget will now be displayed on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the insertion of the new widget.\nOur example of the ‘Welcome banner’ custom dashboard widget could look like this when inserted and moved to the top of the dashboard page:\nHow Custom dashboard widgets are created A Kianda Administrator or Developer can create Custom dashboard widgets by opening the Administration menu from the left-side menu and clicking on Developer:\nThe Developer resources page opens and displays all of the Custom widgets that have been created - these include Custom field widgets, Custom rule widgets and Custom Dashboard widgets.\nNote: Only Custom dashboard widgets will be shown in the Custom drop-down list in the Widget menu on dashboard pages.\nTo create a new Custom dashboard widget, a Developer/Administrator needs to:\nClick on the New widget button .\nAn Edit widget dialog box opens, in which they can choose the Title, Unique ID, Widget icon and Widget type for the new custom widget.\nTo create a new Dashboard Widget, the Developer/Administrator must choose ‘Dashboard widget’ as the Widget type, as shown in this example:\nOnce the Developer/Administrator has completed the Edit widget dialog box and clicks on OK, a workspace opens where they can create their Custom dashboard widget (and a pop-up message displays saying ‘Success saving the widget’):\nThe two workspaces that are shown, Widget UI and Widget Code, show the default code that the Developer/Administrator can then add to this in order to create a dashboard widget with the functionality they want.\nWhen they have finished working on the new custom dashboard widget, they need to click on the Update button and a pop-up message will say ‘Widget updated’.\nClick on the Close button to close the custom dashboard widget workspace.\nThe new custom dashboard widget will now be listed in the Widgets screen in the Developer section:\nDesigners will now be able to see and use the new custom dashboard widget from the Custom section of the Dashboard Widgets menu when they are adding widgets to dashboard pages.\nTo learn more about how to create Custom dashboard widgets, go to Creating a custom Dashboard widget.\nHow to edit Custom dashboard widgets To edit a Custom dashboard widget on a dashboard page:\nIn the dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to view the page in Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button and Bin/Trash button are available).\nClick on the Custom dashboard widget’s Update configuration (Edit) button .\nThe Edit widget dialog box opens, enabling you to make whatever changes are available to you for that particular custom dashboard widget (this will depend on the range of options and functionality the Developer/Administrator who created it gave it). These will be the same options as were outlined in Step 6 of How to get started.\nMaking the changes you want and then click OK.\nThe updated Custom dashboard widget will be shown on the Dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\nHow to move Custom dashboard widgets To move a Custom widget on a dashboard page:\nOn your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\nSelect the Custom dashboard widget’s drag handle button .\nDrag and drop the widget where you want it to go on your dashboard.\nHow to delete Custom dashboard widgets To delete a Custom dashboard widget from your dashboard:\nOn your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\nClick on the widget’s Remove widget (Bin/Trash icon) button .\nA Delete widget dialog box will open. Click on OK to delete the widget (or click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion).\nHow to edit Custom dashboard widget settings To update or edit your Custom dashboard widget settings:\nOn your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\nClick on the Update widget settings (Cog) button .\nThe Edit widget dialog box will open, enabling you to make changes to any of the available options (the same options as were available in the Add widget dialog box discussed in Step 4 of How to get started).\nIn our example, we could choose to reduce the width of the Custom dashboard widget to be 4 columns wide, by clicking to the left of the existing blue bar.\nClick on OK to confirm the changes you’ve made to the widget settings (or click on Close if you don’t want to retain any changes).\nThe updated Custom dashboard widget will display on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\nSaving changes Make sure to save any changes you make to your Custom dashboard widget by clicking on the Save button in the dashboard top menu. If you leave the dashboard without saving the changes you have made to a widget, the next time you visit the dashboard it won’t include any of the changes made to it since the dashboard page was last saved.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about Custom dashboard widgets, find out more about the other types of Dashboard widgets you can add to your Kianda dashboard:\nChart widget Filter widget Rich Text widget Link widget List widget Tile widget Walkthrough widget Custom dashboard widget ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"There are currently seven pre-defined dashboard widgets that you can …","ref":"/docs/platform/pages/custom/","tags":"","title":"Custom dashboard widgets"},{"body":" Page under construction\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Page under construction\n","ref":"/docs/troubleshooting/custom-widget-debugging/","tags":"","title":"Custom widget debugging"},{"body":"Kianda dashboards deliver a convenient way to provide insights into how your business processes are performing. Dashboards offer easy reporting, permissions management, quick build, condition-based filtering and many more useful features.\nFrom lists to tiles, filters and charts, dashboards allow you to build full digital experiences to monitor your real-time processes in a few minutes.\nThere are 3 steps involved in creating a dashboard:\nCreate a dashboard page. Add one or more widgets. Configure or edit the widgets to make the page look the way you want. This page covers how to create, edit, and delete dashboards and give an overview of how to add widgets to a dashboard page.\nIf you are using Kianda predefined processes from the App Store, then dashboards have already been created for you! These are available by clicking on Dashboard from the main side menu or left-hand pane.\nBefore you begin, it is important to be aware that there are two modes involved in dashboard pages, an Edit mode and View mode as described below.\nEdit mode and View mode When using dashboards, there are two modes: Edit mode and View mode.\nDashboards View mode When you are in View mode, the Edit button will be visible to the right in the top menu bar.\nDashboards Edit mode When you click on the Edit current page button you will be in Edit mode. When you are viewing a page in Edit mode, these options will be available to you along the top of the dashboard page:\nthe Widget menu where you can insert any of the seven available dashboard widgets the Settings button to make changes to the dashboard page the Bin/Trash button to delete the dashboard page the Add layout container button to add a layout container to the dashboard page in order to organise the widgets on the page and achieve the layout you want three buttons on each widget on the dashboard that allow you to edit the options relating to that widget type (Update configuration), edit the widget settings (Update widget settings) or delete the widget from the dashboard (Remove widget) If you want to create a dashboard page from scratch go to How to create a dashboard page or if you want to learn more about dashboard widgets go to Dashboard widgets.\nHow to create a Dashboard page Kianda offers a user-friendly interface to create dashboards in minutes. This video covers the steps for creating a new dashboard:\nYour browser does not support the video tag. To create a new Dashboard page:\nClick on Home in the left-hand pane\nClick on the Create a new page icon A Create dashboard page dialog box will open, allowing you to choose from a range of options for your new dashboard page:\nThe options in the Create dashboard page dialog box include:\nTitle - The title of the dashboard page. You can insert whatever title you want - for example, ‘Training Requests’.\nName - This is a unique name for the dashboard.\nVisible to - You can decide who will be able see the dashboard. You can select single or multiple users or Groups or a combination of the two (as shown here):\nNote: Levels of Security\nDashboard-level security can only be applied if you are an Administrator and can set the visibility of dashboards and widgets. The dashboard page-level security you are setting here - who can see the dashboard page - will override any security you set for the visibility of individual widgets on that dashboard. See Dashboard security and Widget security for more information.\nWidget security: You will also be able to set security for each of the individual widgets that you add to the dashboard, i.e. who can view each dashboard widget.\nIcon - You can choose an icon for your dashboard page from a drop-down list of hundreds of available icons.\nThe icon you select will appear next to the dashboard title when you click on Dashboard in the left side menu to view all of the available dashboards:\nSort order - Choose a numeric value - by either typing it into the field or by clicking on the up down arrows at the right of the field - for the place you want this dashboard to go in terms of the order of the dashboard pages in your main left side menu.\nGroup - You can choose to group this dashboard as a sub-page of an existing dashboard page. If you want to do this, insert the name of the dashboard page you want to group this new dashboard page under.\nEnable favourites - Select this checkbox if you want to insert an ‘Add to favourites’ button to the top menu in the dashboard.\nOnce you complete the Create dashboard page dialog box and click OK, and then click the Save button in the top dashboard menu, a new ‘Add to favourites’ button will be added to your top dashboard menu:\nIf you want to add the current dashboard to your favourites:\nClick the Add to favourites button Complete the Add to favourite dialog box that opens and then click the Add favourite button to add this dashboard to your favourites (or click Close to cancel adding it to your favourites):\nIf you click ‘Add favourite’, the dialog box will close and a pop-up message will display saying ‘Favourite saved successfully’. A new star icon will now appear next to this dashboard page in the Dashboards menu in the main left side menu (denoting that it is a favourite page).\nClick on the OK button when you are have completed the Create dashboard page dialog box (or click on Close to close the dialog box and cancel the creation of the new dashboard page).\nThe output is a menu with a number of widgets available that you can add to the dashboard.\nNote: To add a widget to a dashboard, simply click on the widget type from the widget menu when you are in Edit mode. See How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page and How to add widgets to a Dashboard page to learn more, and go to Dashboard widgets to find out more about each widget type.\nClick on the Save button in the top menu to save any changes you make to the new Dashboard page - a pop-up message saying ‘Page saved successfully’ will display.\nAlternatively, if you don’t want to save the changes you’ve made to the page, click on the Stop editing page button to return to View mode without saving changes:\nYou are now in View mode. To make further changes to the dashboard page, return to Edit mode by clicking on the Edit button in the top menu.\nHow to edit a Dashboard page Click on the Edit current page button to go into Edit mode.

It works in a way that is similar to how a Panel layout control is used in a form to organise the fields in a form.\nTo add a layout container to a Dashboard:\nClick on the Edit current page button to go into Edit mode.\nClick the green Add layout container button at the bottom right of the dashboard page.\nComplete the Create a layout container dialog box that opens by inserting a name and then selecting the width you want for the layout container (by selecting how wide the blue bar is):\nNote:\nIf you know the layout you want for your Dashboard, in terms of what widgets you want to put where and how large you want the various widgets to be, insert layout containers before you start adding widgets to your dashboard page. Then, when you insert each widget, you can choose which layout container you want to assign it to when you are creating the widget.\nAlternatively, if you aren’t sure what widgets you are going to add or what layout you want for your dashboard, you can simply start adding widgets to your dashboard without any layout containers. Once you have added the widgets to the dashboard, you can either drag and drop the widgets to get the dashboard page layout you want or you can go back and insert layout containers and assign widgets to those containers but clicking on the Update widget settings button for each widget.\nFor example, for this existing widget, by opening the Edit widget dialog box, we can now choose to assign it to any of the four available layout containers:\nHow to add widgets to a Dashboard page To add a widget to a Dashboard page:\nClick on the Edit current page button to go into Edit mode.\nIf you know the layout you want for your Dashboard, click the green Add layout container button to create a layout container or several layout containers.

You could also add conditions to a display count - for example, you could add a condition of “Status” equals “In-progress” so that the count of process instances with a status of “In-progress” is displayed.\nChart widget: Using a Chart widget, you could display a pie chart, bar chart or a line chart in your dashboard. These charts can be used to represent various conditions in a process.\nList widget: The List widget displays the instances (individual records) of the selected process. It can also be used to connect with any other widget to display the filtered items.\nFilter widget: The Filter widget can be used to filter process instances based on a field. For example, process instances could be filtered by status.\nLink widget: The Link widget can be used to add a link to a new process, dashboard or any external sources (such as SharePoint or a website).\nWalk through widget: The Walk-through widget allows you to create a walk-through of a process quickly which could be made available to a user, group or organisation.\nWhen you have added one or more dashboard widgets, you can move the widgets around the dashboard page using the Drag handle button. This is possible when you are in Edit mode, see Edit mode and View mode.\nHow to edit Dashboard page settings To edit a Dashboard page:\nClick on the Edit current page button to go into Edit mode.\nClick on the Settings button .\nAn Edit dashboard page dialog box opens:\nThe options available are the same as those available in the Create dashboard page dialog box used to create a new dashboard page - see How to create a dashboard page - but there are also two additional options:\nDisplay in mobile footer - Select this checkbox to display a link to the dashboard in the footer of a mobile phone when the Kianda workspace is accessed on a mobile. Here we can see the example of a link to a dashboard page called ‘Staff onboarding’ available in the footer of a mobile phone:\nHide from navigation - Select this checkbox if you want to hide this dashboard from the navigation in the left side menu.\nNote: Selecting this option will override whatever options you may have inserted in the ‘Visible to’ option in the Create dashboard page dialog box (which allows you to restrict who can see the dashboard). Selecting Hide from navigation will mean the dashboard page will not be visible to anyone in the main side menu.\nClick on the OK button to save the changes you have made in the Edit dashboard page dialog box (or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving). Click on the Save button in the top dashboard menu to save the changes to the page. Enabling data export from dashboards Kianda allows users to export the data from dashboards with a simple click.\nThis video explains how to set up the configuration to export data from dashboards:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

They might be used as a stage of a process and can be made active individually or at the same time (parallel forms).\nHow Designer works This video introduces Kianda Designer and demonstrates how to start creating a form and add fields.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. There are 3 key principles to consider when working with forms:\nForm design - what a form looks like, what elements it contains, for example controls and rules Form interaction - how users can use forms depending on certain sequences happening Form management - who can edit and access forms This page presents the information you need related to form design, that is what a form looks like, and what it contains. By default, form designers can edit forms, but they can also set how other people interact with forms, for example to make forms viewable as read-only. Go to Form management to find out more about how form ownership works, and Form interaction to find out how a complete process flow works once forms are designed and assigned. Read the steps below to find out more about Form design.\nDesigner layout To access processes, go to the left-hand pane and Administration \u003e Designer and click on a process that you have created or imported, see Getting started with Kianda processes.\nFrom the main process view, click on any process to add forms. The designer window opens and is made up of 3 main parts.\nThe key components of the designer are:\nLeft-hand pane contains both controls and rules that can be added to forms. Go to Controls and Rules to find out more. The left-hand pane also houses the Exit button to go back to the process list, the Save button to save your work, the Preview button to preview what you have created and the Publish button to publish your work.\nNote that clicking on Save saves a draft which is not available to users until you click on Publish.\nThe central area is where the current form canvas is displayed. The canvas also houses 3 buttons by default: Submit, Save and Close. Go to Adding form elements to find out more about editing these buttons and adding elements to the canvas.\nThe right-hand pane is where the properties and rules are displayed for the selected item, see Properties for more information. From this pane you can also Import forms, see the Version history for a process and set process Settings. Click on the links to find out more.\nNote the name of the process you are working on is shown in the top menu bar, for example Quarterly Training Request.\nHow to get started How you get started with forms depends on:\nif you have created a process using the App Store, see Predefined forms\nif you have created a process from scratch or want to create a form from scratch, see New forms\nif you import forms that have already been created, see Import forms\nOnce your form is created, you are ready to start adding elements to your form, see Adding form elements.\nIn addition there are a number of settings you can change, see Settings and Properties.\nPredefined forms If you have created a process using the App Store, then a number of forms will already be part of the process. For example the process Security Incident Management has 5 forms attached: Incident detail, Data breach, Malware outbreak, Root cause remedy and Caller review.\nTo edit form details, simply click on a form and click on the Pen button to edit the form. You can also click on the Add form button to add a new form. Edit options are shown under New forms.\nNew forms How to add new form\nYour browser does not support the video tag. If you have created a process from scratch, an empty form is added to your process by default, called “form 1”. This is the first form. Click on this form and the Edit/Pen button to customise it. You can also click on the Add form button to add a new form.\nEditing forms When you click on a chosen form, then click on the Edit/Pen button to edit the form.\nThe Edit form dialog box opens where you can edit the fields. There are a number of edit options below.\nNote: as you change any of the options in the dialog box, the impact will be shown in real-time on the form in the background, for example a title, or colour form theme.\nTitle - the form title, for example Employee Request Form\nName - this is a unique name for the form\nDefault owner(s) - by default the form creator is an owner. You can remove this owner by clicking on and add other owners by clicking on the arrow and choose from Users, Groups or Partners.\nUsers - allows you to choose individual owners Groups - allows you to choose from defined groups for example HR Team or Management Team Partners - allows you to choose predefined partner organisations that you want to share with or provide permissions Activate with - will decide when the form will be active. If you have several forms attached to a process, then select from a dropdown list the form you want to activate with the current form. If you leave the field blank, the new form will be activated sequentially after the first form is submitted.\nSubmit mode - options are a) Only this form (the current form) or b) All forms in edit mode\nForm icon - click on the arrow to choose from hundreds of icons to attach to your form.\nForm theme - choose from Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White Colours for your form.\nEnable quick actions - if you tick the checkbox, you can select from the options a) Enable re-assign b) Enable edit and c) Enable custom action. Click on Ellipsis button to further modify the action settings.\nIf you click on Enable re-assign, you can reassign action settings to particular Users, Groups or Partners. Click on Allow form owners if you want form owners to be able to reassign actions.\nIf you click on Enable edit, you can allow certain Users, Groups or Partners to edit the form, along with form owners by clicking on Allow form owners.\nOther options include a checkbox for When editing auto hide form footer buttons and Trigger rules on save.\nIf you check Trigger rules on save then click into the Save action field to choose from an action trigger as to when the form is saved, for example Submit, Save or Close. These can be other actions depending on what you have defined. If you click on Enable custom action, you can allow certain Users, Groups or Partners to edit the form, along with form owners by clicking on Allow form owners.\nOther options include Action label, Target action field and Action display mode, for example Read-only mode, Edit mode or Both.\nAs a form designer, you can set up actions dependent on certain conditions, for example an Action label that targets a certain button appearing for example Close button, only when a certain display mode is chosen, for example Read-only mode. If Edit mode is chosen, then the button will only appear when the form is being edited. In this way you can create dynamic forms that suit user interactions.\nClick on the OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\nTo save your changes to the form, click on the Save button .\nYou are now ready to start adding Controls and Rules to your form. To implement additional settings, see Process Settings.\nImport forms You can import a previously designed form by clicking on the Import button .\nClick on the arrow to select from the drop down list to Select a process design.\nClick on a process of interest and then click on the forms to import. Forms are indicated by a + symbol and can be expanded to show elements within a form for example a panel containing different fields such as lists and text boxes. This means you can import a whole form, or just elements of a form. In this way you can very quickly reuse some or all parts of an existing form.\nClick on the OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\nAdding form elements If you have added a new form during the form creation process, then a blank canvas with 3 default buttons are available to you: Submit, Save and Close.\nYou can:\nAdd elements to this canvas by clicking on Controls and Rules in the left-hand pane. Click on each link to find out more about the 16 Control fields and Move elements by clicking on the Drag Handle beside the item and dragging it to where you want to place it. Edit elements by clicking on each item and clicking on the Pen button , for example if you click on the Close button, there are a number of options to choose from when editing see Form buttons. Settings and Properties In addition to the edits above, there are a number other actions and settings that you can implement to your process and forms.\nSettings are available from the right-hand pane and give you the ability to:\nView Design version history\nChange Process settings\nCreate a duplicate form by selecting a form, clicking on the Clone button and then click on Ok. A version called ‘Form Name Copy’ is created and available to edit on the canvas. The Clone button can also be used to clone form elements like controls or buttons.\nEdit form information by selecting a form and clicking on the Pen button .\nDelete a form by selecting a form, clicking on the Bin/Trash button and then click on Ok after you have reviewed the form title and you are sure this is what you want to delete. Click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion.\nView and edit Form properties and rules\nEdit form buttons by clicking on a button of choice and then Change field, see Form buttons.\nProcess settings You can edit process settings by clicking on the Settings button in the right-hand pane.\nChoose from the settings:\nProcess id settings - choose from a) Default or b) Custom and use a combination of [ProcessName]-[UniqueNumber]-[FieldName]\nEnable process security - if you tick the checkbox, you can allow certain Users, Groups or Partners to have certain privileges related to the radio button options to create, assign and view as shown below.\nThe default setting is Security users can create, assign to can update, everyone else can view.\nOn load rules execution mode - options are a) Always b) When in edit mode or c) When open new. The default setting is Always.\nHide form tabs - gives you the ability to hide form tabs, options are a) Yes or b) No.\nHide left nav - gives you the ability to hide navigation elements, options are a) Yes or b) No.\nEnable anonymous sharing of forms - gives you the ability to share forms with people outside your organisation for example a feedback form or GDPR subject access request. Options are a) Yes or b) No. If you click on Yes there are various options that you can add:\nMessage to display after anonymous submission - to add a display message Hide form topbar - checkbox to allow you to hide the form form topbar. Force log out - options are a) Yes or b) No to force user logout once the form is submitted Click on New link to generate a new anonymous form link to share with users and click on Edit to change the link. Enable mobile bottom navigation - options are a) Yes or b) No.\nInstance delete settings - options are a) Any user can delete b) Creator can delete c) “Current form owner” can delete d) “Security users” can delete e) “Admins only” can delete. The default setting is Creator can delete.\nEnable form assignment notification - options are a) Yes or b) No.\nPrevent closing instance with unsaved data - options are a) Yes or b) No.\nSelected tab theme - choose from Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White as a colour when a form is selected.\nCompleted tab theme - choose from Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White as a colour when a form is completed.\nClick on the OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\nClick on the Exit button to go back to the process list, the Save button to save your work, the Preview button to preview what you have created and the Publish button to publish your work.\nForm properties and rules Form properties are visible in the right-hand pane and show:\nTitle - the form title, for example Employee Request Form\nVisible - click on this checkbox if you want the form to be visible to users\nShow info - click on this checkbox if you want to show information about form metadata at runtime like process version, owners and last modified by\nGo to Rules to find out more about Form rules.\nForm buttons By default there are 3 buttons on all forms, Submit, Save and Close, but you can change these to buttons in a myriad of ways to customise your users’ experience. See sections Editing a button, Copying a button, Changing button properties and Deleting a button below.\nEditing a button To edit a button:\nClick on the button and then the Pen button .\nChoose from the edit options:\nTitle - the button name, for example Close\nName - this is a unique name for the button\nHelp text - information to help the form user\nColor scheme - choose from Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White Colours for your button colour\nIcon - click on the arrow in the dropdown list to select from several hundred icons\nShow in form body - options are a) Yes or b) No\nEnable button security - options are a) Yes or b) No\nClick on the OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\nYou can change the button to a different field type by clicking on the button itself and the Change field button in the right-hand pane. Then choose from one of 18 field types and edit the field chosen. See Controls for more information on field types.\nChanging button properties To edit button properties, click on the button itself and the properties appear in the right-hand pane.\nThe options within properties are:\nTitle - the name of the button, for example Close Show title - show the title of the button Enabled - the field is enabled for users to use Visible - the button is visible to users Perform validation Show in display mode Layout - change the width of the field by clicking on the bar in the Layout box until you see the desired size, from 1 to 12 columns. Click on the arrow beside Layout to see the Mobile Layout and click on the bar to change the width for mobile use. Rules - rules for input fields. These are covered in details in Rules. Copying a button or field To copy a button you can click on Clone button in the right-hand pane and choose from the options:\nSelect destination - click into the field and then choose from another form associated to that process or a panel within another form Move field instead - the box to move the field instead of copying Click on the OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\nDeleting a button or field Click on the on the Bin/Trash button and then click on Ok after you have reviewed the form title and you are sure this is what you want to delete.

We will keep this example in mind as we learn more about using the Field group control.\nHow to get started To add a Field group to a form, first open the relevant process - in our case, we will open the Education Request Process.\nThen select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible) - we will select the ‘Training Approval’ form. Go to Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.\nOur Training Approval form contains two Panels - the first Panel currently only contains the Richtext field titled ‘Training Details’, the second Panel contains fields related to the approval decision. Panels are sections within your form - to learn more, go to Panel control. We will use the Field group control to add fields from the ‘Training Request’ form to the first panel.\nInsert the Field group by clicking on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu, then select Layout to view the range of Layout controls and click on Field group.\nA New field - Field group dialog box will open with a range of options you can choose from for your new Field group:\n​\tThe options available in the New field - Field group dialog box include:\nTitle - You can change the title of the Field group from the default title of ‘Field group 1’\nName - This is a unique name for the field\nHelp text - You can insert text to help the form user to complete the Field group - if you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\nSelect fields to group or mirror - You can choose one or more fields from the current process to group or mirror by clicking on the field or fields to select them. You can expand forms (listed with a plus sign beside them) to view all of the fields within them by clicking on the form title in the list. Select as many fields as you want.\nIn our example, we will select three fields in the ‘Training Request’ form that we want to be shown on the ‘Training Approval’ form - Employee Name, Type of Training and Reason:\nGrouped fields - The field(s) you select will automatically be grouped together in the Grouped fields section at the bottom of the dialog box - click on Grouped fields so that it expands to show the list of fields you have chosen:\nThe fields you have chosen being ‘grouped’ together will mean that you will be able to edit them and move them around your form as a group (rather than as individual fields).\nIf there is a field or fields you do not want to be grouped, simply click on the Bin/Trash icon to the right and that field will no longer be grouped with the others.\nYou can also change the order of the fields within the Field group by simply clicking on the field’s drag handle button and dragging and dropping the field where you want it to be.\nNote that selected fields grouped under the current field group are not copied only referenced.\nOnce you have completed the New field - Field group dialog box, click OK and the new Field group will be added to your form.\nBy default, the Title of the new Field group will not be shown (unless you choose to display it, by selecting the Show title checkbox in the Field properties menu to the right).\nIn our example, our new Field group contains the three fields we chose:\nHow to edit, move and delete Field groups To edit a Field group:\nSelect the field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s Drag handle button ) Click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) The Edit field - Field group dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - Field group dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).\nTo move a Field group:\nSelect the field’s Drag handle button Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to within your form. Note that the grouped fields are available to move and edit as a group within the form. To delete a Field group from your form:\nSelect the group by clicking on the group’s Drag handle button Click on the Bin/Trash button Click on OK to confirm (or click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion) How to edit Field group properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a Field group, select the field (by clicking on the field title or field drag handle button ) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a Field group field titled ‘Field group 1’ are shown here and include:\nField type - The type of field, in this case a Field group.\nTitle - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Field group 1’.\nShow title - If this is selected, the Field group title will be shown in the form. In this case, the ‘Show title’ checkbox has not been selected, so it won’t be shown in the form.\nRequired - If this is selected, the field will be mandatory for form users to complete.\nEnabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field.\nVisible - If this is selected, the Field group will be visible in the form.\nLayout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the Field group as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right).\nTo learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about the Field group control, find out more about the other types of Layout fields you can add to a Kianda process:\nModal dialog control Panel layout control Richtext control ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"A Field group control is a convenient way to mirror a group of fields …","ref":"/docs/platform/controls/layout/field-group/","tags":"","title":"Field group control"},{"body":" Page under construction\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Page under construction\n","ref":"/docs/platform/connectors/file-system/","tags":"","title":"File system"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/platform/dashboards/filter/","tags":"","title":"Filter widget"},{"body":"A dashboard Filter widget can be used to create a filter or filters that enable you to change the information that is displayed on your dashboard, based on criteria you choose.\nFor example, if you have an ‘Annual Leave’ dashboard that contains a List widget that shows the individual annual leave requests (process instances) submitted by employees, you could add a Filter widget to the dashboard and connect the List widget to it. This would add a Filter widget to your dashboard that enables you to filter the annual leave requests in the List widget by employee name.\nHow to get started To add a Filter widget to a dashboard:\nOpen the relevant dashboard page. To learn how to create your first dashboard page, go to How to create a dashboard page.\nFor this example, we’ll open a dashboard page called ‘Annual Leave’ that has a List widget on it showing the individual records (process instances) for annual leave requests made by employees:\nClick on the Edit current page button from the top dashboard menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button , Bin/Trash button and Add layout container button are available):\nClick on the Filter widget button in the Dashboard Widget menu.\nThe Add widget dialog box opens with a range of options for your new Filter widget.\nChoose the options you want:\nTitle - You can insert the title you want for your Filter widget (instead of the default title that is shown). In our example, we’ll call it ‘Filter by Employee’.\nLayout columns - You can choose how wide you want your Filter widget to be. You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click to the very end of the bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.\nColour scheme - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White), if you choose to display it.\nShow header - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your Dashboard widget to be shown. This checkbox is selected by default, so de-select it if you don’t want the header to be displayed.\nVisible to - You can choose who will be able to see the Filter widget. Select single or multiple Users or Groups, or a combination of the two. You can use the menu on the right to either filter the drop-down list by Users or Groups. To find out more about pre-defined Groups on Kianda, go to Users \u0026 Groups.\nNote - Dashboard page security: When a dashboard page is first created, the users(s)/group(s) who will be able to view the dashboard are selected in the ‘Visible to’ option in the Create dashboard page dialog box (see Step 3 in How to create a Dashboard page).\nYou can also edit or update this setting at any point to change who has permission to view a particular dashboard page. This higher dashboard-level security setting will take precedence over the security settings (‘Visible to’) that are applied to the individual widgets within the dashboard (such as the Filter widget, in this case).\nSee Dashboard security and Widget security for more information.\nLayout container: This option will only display if you have already created layout containers for your Dashboard page. Here, you can select the layout container you want to place your new Filter widget in.\nA layout container is a simple way to organise, arrange and move the widgets you add to your dashboard. To learn more about layout containers, go to How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page.\nIn this example, we can select to place our new Filter widget into one of three layout containers - Top, Middle or Bottom:\nDevice visibility - You can choose what devices and types of internet connections the dashboard Filter widget will be visible on - select all the options you want from Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, Wi-Fi and Flight mode as to when the device can view the dashboards. By default, all options are selected.\nClick on OK when you’ve completed the Add widget dialog box.\nA Filter settings dialog box automatically opens showing the options for the Filter widget:\nSelect the options you want for your Filter widget:\nFilter type: You can choose the way you want the filter options to be displayed for the end user. The options are Dropdown list, Radio list, Date range, Free text or Current user.\nDropdown list - Select this option if you want the filter options to be shown in a dropdown list.\nRadio list - Select this option if you want the filter options to be shown in a radio list.\nDate range - Select this option if you want the filter options to be shown as date ranges. If you select Date range as the Filter type, you then have two filter options - Date or Date and time:\nFree text - Select this option if you want the filter options to consist of free text.\nCurrent user - Select this option if you want to filter by current user. If you select Current user as the Filter type, you then need to choose the Current user property from a drop-down list:\nFilter options - Once you have chosen the Filter type you want - let’s say drop-down list - you can then decide whether the options that the end user can filter are Manual entries (that you input by typing them into the box with the ‘Options one per line’ placeholder text) or are pulled from a Data source.\nIf you select Data source to pull the filter options from a data source, four additional options will be shown:\nDatasource - If you select ‘Data source’ for creating your filter options, next click on the Datasource button. The Select datasource dialog box automatically opens:\nSelect the data source you want to use by selecting one of the available Datasources listed on the left.\nFor our example, we will select Kianda as our data source and then select the ‘Annual leave request and approval process’. We can do this by either\n(a) typing the start of this process name into the ‘datasource tree’ search field and selecting it when it is displayed below it, or\n(b) by clicking on Processes to show the full list of Kianda processes and scrolling and selecting the one we want\nClick OK when you have selected the data source you want to use. The source you selected will now be shown beneath the Datasource button in the Filter settings dialog box.\nEdit conditions - If you want to add a condition to your filter\nClick the Edit conditions button and the Edit conditions dialog box will open\nClick the Add conditions group button Add the condition you want and click on OK.\nNote: To see an example of adding a condition to a filter, see the ‘Add connections’ option further down.\nDisplay field - Choose the field you want displayed as the field options.\nIn our example - setting up a Filter widget to filter annual leave requests by employee name - we chose a Kianda process as the data source for the filter options, so when we click on the Display field, we can then expand the relevant form (Request form) and select the field we want to filter by:\nValue field - Choose the value you want displayed as the field options. Typically, the same field will be chosen as both the Display field and Value field (but you could choose different fields as needed).\nIn our example, we will select the ‘Employee Name’ field from the ‘Request form’ in the ‘Annual leave request and approval process’ for both the Display field and Value field:\nFilter mode - You can choose whether the filter widget displays options that start with the letters or words the user types into the filter widget search box or shows filter options that contain the letters or words the user inputs.\nDefault value - You can choose a Default value to appear in the Filter widget.\nEnable query string - This option appears for all Filter types except for Date range and Current user.\nTo enable a query string:\nSelect the ‘Enable query string checkbox. Insert the unique field name of the field you want to filter by into the box with the ‘Parameter name’ placeholder text. Note - You can find the unique field name by going to the form that contains the field and clicking on the Edit field button to open the Edit field dialog box and copying the unique field name from the ‘Name (Unique)’ field.\nIn our example, we can find the unique field name we need to enable a query string by\nOpening the Annual Leave process\nSelecting the ‘Employee Name’ field in the Annual Leave Request form - the field we want to filter by in our Filter widget.\nOpening the Edit field dialog box to find the field’s unique name:\nIn our Filter settings dialog box, we can now select the ‘Enable query string’ checkbox and insert this unique field name into the Parameter name box - we will also select the ‘Auto update URL’ option (which will dynamically construct a URL, meaning that the URL at the top of the page will automatically change when we choose a filter option):\nOnce you complete the Filter settings dialog box and click OK and then click the Save button in the top menu, you will now see that when you select an employee in the Filter widget, the URL at the top updates:\nSetting the filter up like this to automatically update the URL when a filter option is selected enables you to make any of the filter selections a dashboard favourite page.\nFor example, we could now choose to make this filter selection - Maddy Leenane’s annual leave requests - a favourited dashboard page by clicking on the Add to favourites button in the top menu and completing the Add to favourite dialog box that opens:\nAdd connections - Click on the Add connections button if you want to add a filter connection to an existing widget on the dashboard, so that the data displayed in that widget is filtered based on the option selected in the Filter widget.\nThe Filter connection dialog box opens - click on the down arrow and select the dashboard widget you want to connect to:\nYou can then choose to add filter conditions to the widget filter connection by\n(a) clicking on the Add filter conditions button (b) clicking the Add a conditions group button in the Edit conditions dialog box that opens\n(c) completing the Edit conditions dialog box to apply conditions to the widget filter connection and then clicking on OK\nIn our example, we would add a filter condition to the widget filter connection by selecting ‘Employee Name’ in the field on the left and ‘Filter value’ in the field on the right. This will ensure that the ‘Employee Name’ field will display as the filter value.\nOnce you have completed the Filter connection dialog box, click OK. The widget you have connected to the new Filter widget will now be shown under Widget connections:\nClick on the OK button when you are finished choosing the options you want for your Filter widget in the Filter settings dialog box (or click on Close to exit the Edit link dialog box without saving).\nClick on the Save button in the top dashboard menu to save the insertion of the new Filter widget.\nYour new Filter widget will now be displayed on your dashboard.\nOur example of a Filter widget for the ‘Annual Leave’ dashboard - where the filter allows users to filter the Annual Leave Request records in the existing List Widget by employee name - could look like this:\nWhen the user clicks on the down arrow button in the Filter widget, the names of employees who have submitted an Annual Leave Request are shown in a drop-down list.\nThe user can then select an employee name from the drop-down list and the List widget to the right will automatically update to only show Annual Leave Request records (process instances) submitted by that employee. This is because we used the Widget connection option to connect that List widget to the new Filter widget.\nHow to edit Filter widgets To edit a Filter widget on a dashboard:\nIn the dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to view the page in Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button and Bin/Trash button are available).\nClick on the Filter widget’s Update configuration (Edit) button .\nThe Filter settings dialog box opens, enabling you to make whatever changes you want to the filter using the same range of options as outlined in Step 6 of How to get started.\nMaking the changes you want and then click OK.\nThe updated Filter widget will be shown on the Dashboard.

Click on OK to delete the widget (or click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion).\nClick on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\nHow to edit Filter widget settings To update or edit your Filter widget settings:\nOn your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\nClick on the Update widget settings (Cog) button .\nThe Edit widget dialog box will open, enabling you to make changes to any of the available options (the same options as were available in the Add widget dialog box discussed in Step 4 of How to get started).\nIn our example, we could choose to reduce the width of the Filter widget to be 4 columns wide, by clicking to the left of the existing blue bar.\nClick on OK to confirm the changes you’ve made to the widget settings (or click on Close if you don’t want to retain any changes).\nThe updated Filter widget will display on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\nSaving changes Make sure to save any changes you make to your Filter widget by clicking on the Save button in the dashboard top menu. If you leave the dashboard without saving the changes you have made to a widget, the next time you visit the dashboard it won’t include any of the changes made to it since the dashboard page was last saved.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about the Dashboard Filter widget, find out more about the other types of Dashboard widgets you can add to your Kianda dashboard:\nChart widget Link widget Rich Text widget List widget Tile widget Walkthrough widget Custom dashboard widget ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"A dashboard Filter widget can be used to create a filter or filters …","ref":"/docs/platform/pages/filter/","tags":"","title":"Filter widget"},{"body":"This rule allows you to find a user from a data source using a Kianda process.\nWhen to use Use this rule to pull user data into a Kianda form for example when someone wants to add employee information to a form using SharePoint details.\nYou can add this rule:\nto a field to a form to a process (the rule will run on load) How to use To apply this rule, first choose an item to attach the rule to and have a SharePoint data source ready where you want the list to be located.

Forms contain all the buttons, fields, and rule triggers needed to execute your process.\nThere are three principles to consider when working with forms:\nReading modes: Form users can either use forms in edit mode or read mode. Edit mode means that users can submit information, while read mode means that users can only view forms. The latter may be useful for example for certain staff to review feedback in a form, but not be able to edit/update it. See Rules for more information on different types of rules. Form owner: The default owner is the person or group that the form is assigned to when the the form is created. By default, only this person or group can edit the form. All other users can only view forms in read mode. The default owner however can reassign forms to other individuals and/or groups. Current form: Typically there are several forms in a process, and only the form that has the status ‘current form’ is editable. However, in a complex multi-step process, other forms can be configured to activate with the current form, meaning they can also become editable at the same time, creating a form group. These three considerations are established when the form is created, as seen in the dialog box below. These properties can also change dynamically as a result of rules being applied. See Rules for more information on different types of rules.\nNew form dialog box\nNew form considerations The Default owner(s) field is where you can set individuals and groups as the default form owners who can edit the form. Activate with means that the form can be activated with other forms within the process, so they can be edited at the same time. This means several forms become the current form in a form group. Submit mode means that when a process instance is running you can choose only this form to be submitted, or you can choose all forms in edit mode meaning that several forms could have their details submitted or saved. Enable quick actions allows you to statically enable a) reassignment, b) edit, and c) custom actions on any form. For a) and b) you can choose individuals and/or groups who can reassign or edit forms. In the case of b) edit there are options to hide form footer buttons when editing, and to trigger rules on save against a set field when saving edits. For c) custom actions, you can set your own custom action and create an action label against a particular form field. This means that the user(s) assigning the custom action will see the labelled action designated for them. As a designer you can choose the action display mode as read-only, edit or both, so you can decide what type of access the user(s) will have.

For example, you may wish to insert an image at the top of your form or may wish to enable form users to annotate an image.\nHow to get started To add an Image field to a Kianda form:\nOpen an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer in the left side menu and clicking on a process, or create a new process in Designer. See Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.\nOnce you have opened your process, select the form you want to work on (so that the Edit Form button is shown).\nIn this example, a Training Approval form in an Education Request Process has been selected:\nSelect the area within the form where you want to insert the Image field - in our example, we will select the first panel in the form - Training Details:\nClick on Controls in the left-hand pane, and, from the four categories of Controls (Input, Layout, Actions and Custom), click on Actions.\nSelect Image from the four types of Action fields: Button, Link, Image and Signature:\nA New field - Image dialog box will automatically open, giving you options for your new Image field:\nThe options available in the New field - Image dialog box include:\nTitle - You can change the name of the Image field from the default ‘Image 1’. In our example, we could change the title to ‘Employees’.\nName (Unique) - This is a unique name for the new field.\nHelp text - You can insert text to help the form user. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\nImage source - You can choose to insert the image either from an Image URL or from a File field within the form. Different additional options will be available to you, dependent on the Image source you choose.\n(i) If you choose Image URL as the Image source, insert the URL for the image into the Image URL field:\nThen complete the Image max height and Image max width options:\nImage max height - Insert the maximum height (in pixels) for your new Image field by either manually inserting a number or using the up down arrows to the right of the field.\nImage max width - Insert the maximum width (in pixels) for your new Image field by either manually inserting a number or using the up down arrows to the right of the field.\nWhen you’ve completed the New field - Image dialog box and clicked OK, your new Image field will be inserted at the bottom of the area you selected - in our case, at the bottom of the first panel in the Training Approval form: (ii) If you choose File field as the Image source, three additional options will be displayed below the ‘Image max height’ and ‘Image max width’ options - Enable image annotations, Display images inline and Enable quick remove image:\nTo use a File field as the Image source, you must first have inserted a File Upload field into your form and it must hold an image file.\nIn our example, you could insert a File Upload field titled ‘Image file’ into the panel where you want to insert the new Image field and then browse to find an image you have saved on your computer:\nYou could choose to make this File Upload field invisible to form users, by ensuring the Visible checkbox is not selected in the Field Properties menu to the right.\nIf you want to allow form users to make annotations on the Image, make sure to select Yes to the Allow file override option in the New field - File dialog box. To learn more about File Upload fields, see File Upload field.\nOnce the File Upload field has been added to the form and it contains the image file you want to use, you can then insert an Image field and, in the dialog box, choose File field as your Image source, click into the File field and select the field containing the image:\nThen complete the Image max height and Image max width fields:\nIn our example, if we inserted an Image field using a File field as the Image source (and choose not to make the File field visible to form users), the new Image field could look like this once inserted in our form:\nYou have three additional options if you choose File field as your Image source:\nEnable image annotations - If you choose Yes, this will enable both you (as the Form Designer) and the end user (the form user) to make annotations to the Image - such as adding a text comment or inserting a shape.\nTo make annotations to the Image as the Form Designer, choose Yes to ‘Enable image annotations’ and after clicking OK at the bottom of the New field - Image dialog box, click on the new Image field that has been added to your form:\nWhen you click on the Image, a new pop-up box will open, with an Annotate Image button at the top right:\nClick on this Annotate Image button and a menu will display with a range of options for annotating the image:\nThe options available for annotating the image include:\n​\t- Undo the last annotation ​\t- Draw a rectangle ​\t- Draw a circle ​\t- Write some text ​\t- Draw an arrow ​\t- Pen tool (which allows you to do a free hand drawing on the image)\n​\t- Redo the last undone annotation .\nAn end user completing the form will be able to make annotations to the image in the same way - by clicking on the Image in the form and then clicking the Annotate Image button to view the menu.\nWhen you have made the changes you want to the image, click on the green Save button . This annotation will then be visible in the image in your form.\nIf you choose Yes to Enable image annotations, another option is shown - Keep original image:\nIf you choose Yes for Keep original image, when the Image field is annotated, both the original image and annotated image will be shown side by side and will both be saved in the location you chose as the ‘Destination’ in the File Upload field.\nDisplay images inline - Select Yes if you want the Image field to appear in line with the text in your form.\nEnable quick remove image - If you select Yes, a Bin/Trash button will be available to the form user at the bottom of the Image field in the form, enabling them to delete the image by clicking on it.\nWhen you have finished selecting the options you want for your new Image field in the New field - Image dialog box, click OK and the Image will be added to your form.\nYou can preview how the image will look to an end user by first saving the changes you’ve made to your form (by clicking on the Save button ) and then clicking the Preview button.\nIn our example, if we added an Image field to our Training Approval form and choose a File field as the Image source and to allow the user to make annotations to the image - it could look like this to user completing the form on their mobile phone:\nIf you chose to enable image annotations, the form user can click on the image, click on the Annotate image button and then use the options in the menu to make annotations on the image and save these.\nHow to edit, move and delete Image fields To edit an Image field:\nSelect the Image field (by either clicking on the field name or on the field’s drag handle button )\nClick on the Edit Field button (Pen icon) The Edit Field - Image dialog box will open (with the Image field title you chose reflected in the dialog box name), enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - Image dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).\nTo move an Image field, simply:\nSelect the Image field’s drag handle button Drag and drop the Image field wherever you want to move it within your form.\nFor example, when we added the ‘Employees’ Image field to the first panel in the Training Approval form, it was automatically inserted at the bottom of the panel - if we want it to show at the top of the panel, we can simply drag the image to the top of the panel and drop it there:\nTo delete an Image field from your form:\nSelect the Image field (by either clicking on the field’s title or drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button Click on OK to confirm. How to view and edit Image control Field properties To view or edit an Image control’s Field properties:\nSelect the Image field (by either clicking on the field title or on its drag handle button ).\nThe Field Properties associated with the Image field will be displayed (and can be changed) in the Field properties menu to the right.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with an Image field titled ‘Employees’ are shown here and include:\nField type - The type of field, in this case an Image field.\nTitle - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Employees’.\nShow title - If this is selected, the Image field title will be shown in the form.\nRequired - If this is selected, the field will be mandatory for the form user.\nEnabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field.\nVisible - If this is selected, the Image field will be visible in the form.\nLayout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the Image field as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right).\nFor more details, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button .

It could be useful to add a Link Field to this form that links to the company’s Employee Handbook. We will keep this example in mind as we learn more about using Link controls.\nHow to get started To add a Link field to a Kianda form:\nOpen an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer in the left side menu and clicking on a process, or create a new process in Designer. See Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.\nOnce you have opened your process, select the form you want to work on (so that the Edit Form button is shown).\nIn this example, a Performance Plan form within an Employee Appraisal Process has been selected:\nSelect the area within the form where you want to insert the new Link field - in our example, we will select the first panel in the ‘Employee Information’ section of the form.\nClick on Controls in the left-hand pane, and, from the four categories of Controls (Input, Layout, Actions and Custom), click on Actions.\nSelect Link from the four types of Action fields: Button, Link, Image and Signature:\nA New field - Link dialog box will automatically open, giving you options for your new Link field.\nThe options available in the New field - Link dialog box include:\nTitle - You can change the name of the Link field from the default ‘Link 1’. In our example, we will change the title to ‘Employee Handbook’.\nName (Unique) - This is a unique name for the new field.\nHelp text - You can insert text to help the form user. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\nIn our example, we could insert this help text:\nThe user will then be able to view this help text by clicking on the question mark icon next to the Link field title:\nLink target - You can choose to have the link either open as a New tab or open in the Same tab the form user is currently in.\nDefault URL - This is where you can insert the URL you want the user to be brought to when they click on the Link field.\nOnce you complete the New field - Link dialog box, click OK and the new Link field is added to your form.\nIn our example, if we changed the default Link field title to ‘Employee Handbook’ and inserted help text (as shown previously), our new Link field could look like this when added to our ‘Performance Plan’ form:\nHow to edit, move and delete Link fields To edit a Link field:\nSelect the Link field (by either clicking on the field name or on the field’s drag handle button )\nClick on the Edit Field button (Pen icon) The Edit Field - Link dialog box will open (with the Link field title you chose reflected in the dialog box name), enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - Link dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).\nTo move a Link field, simply:\nSelect the Link field’s drag handle button Drag and drop the Link field wherever you want to move it within your form.\nFor example, we could move the ‘Employee Handbook’ Link field by selecting its drag handle and dragging and dropping it wherever we want within our Performance Plan form:\nTo delete a Link field from your form:\nSelect the Link field (by either clicking on its title or its drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button Click on OK to confirm. How to view and edit Link control Field properties To view or edit a Link control’s Field properties:\nSelect the Link field (by either clicking on the field’s title or drag handle button ).\nThe Field Properties associated with the Link field field will be displayed (and can be changed) in the Field properties menu to the right.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a Link control titled ‘Employee Handbook’ are shown here and include:\nField type - The type of field, in this case a Link field.

Required - If this is selected, the Link field will be mandatory for the form user. Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field. Visible - If this is selected, the Link field will be visible in the form. Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the Button as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right). ​\tFor more details, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nUser tips If you want the Link to be automatically emailed to someone once the form user clicks on the Submit button, for example, you could apply a Send email rule to the Submit button and reference the Link field in an expression in the email.\nRules allow actions based upon conditions resulting from user interaction with fields. To learn about the different types of rules that you can apply go to Rules, to learn about expressions see Expression builder or for more information specifically about the Send email rule, see Send email.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about Link controls, find out more about the other types of Action fields you can add to Kianda forms:\nButton controls Image controls Signature controls ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Link fields can be used to add custom links to forms, including …","ref":"/docs/platform/controls/actions/link/","tags":"","title":"Link control"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/platform/dashboards/link/","tags":"","title":"Link widget"},{"body":"A dashboard Link widget can be used to create a button link on a dashboard page that initiates a new process instance (by bringing the user straight into the first form of a particular process), links to another dashboard or links to an external website.\nHow to get started To add a Link widget to a dashboard:\nOpen the relevant dashboard page. To learn how to create your first dashboard page, go to How to create a dashboard page.\nFor this example, we’ll open a dashboard page called ‘Annual Leave’ that currently has a Rich Text widget and List widget on it:\nClick on the Edit current page button from the top dashboard menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button , Bin/Trash button and Add layout container button are available):\nClick on the Link widget button in the Dashboard Widget menu.\nThe Add widget dialog box opens with a range of options for your new Link widget.\nChoose the options you want:\nTitle - You can insert the title you want for your Link widget. In our example, we’ll call it ‘Start New Process’.\nLayout columns - You can choose how wide you want your Link widget to be. You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click to the very end of the bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.\nColour scheme - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White), if you choose to display it.\nShow header - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your Dashboard widget to be shown. You will need to select this checkbox if you want the Link widget header to be displayed, as it is not selected by default. If the widget header is not shown, the user will just see the link button.\nVisible to - You can choose who will be able to see the Link widget. Select single or multiple Users or Groups, or a combination of the two. You can use the menu on the right to either filter the drop-down list by Users or Groups. To find out more about pre-defined Groups on Kianda, go to Users \u0026 Groups.\nNote - Dashboard page security: When a dashboard page is first created, the users(s)/group(s) who will be able to view the dashboard are selected in the ‘Visible to’ option in the Create dashboard page dialog box (see Step 3 in How to create a Dashboard page).\nYou can also edit or update this setting at any point to change who has permission to view a particular dashboard page. This higher dashboard-level security setting will take precedence over the security settings (‘Visible to’) that are applied to the individual widgets within the dashboard (such as a Link widget, in this case).\nSee Dashboard security and Widget security for more information.\nLayout container - This option will only display if you have already created layout containers for your Dashboard page. Here, you can select which layout container you want your new Link widget to be placed in.\nA layout container is a simple way to organise, arrange and move the widgets you add to your dashboard. To learn more about layout containers, go to How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page.\nIn this example, we can select to place our new Link widget into one of three layout containers - Top, Middle or Bottom:\nDevice visibility - You can choose what devices and types of internet connections the dashboard Link widget will be visible on - select all the options you want from Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, Wi-Fi and Flight mode as to when the device can view the dashboards. By default, all options are selected.\nClick on OK when you’ve completed the Add widget dialog box.\nAn Edit button links dialog box automatically opens showing the Link widget title you inserted in the Add widget dialog box:\nClick on the title of the Link widget or on the Edit link button to open the Edit link dialog box.\nNote: You can click on the Add link button to add more link buttons to the Link widget. You will be able to edit the options relating to each of these individual link buttons by clicking on their title or on their Edit link button.\nSelect the options you want for this link button in your Link widget in the Edit link dialog box.\nThe options available for your Link widget include:\nLink text - You can insert the text you want to appear on your Link widget button.\nNew Process/ Dashboard/ External - You can select whether you want the Link widget to link to a new instance of an existing Kianda process, to an existing dashboard or to an external website.\nIf you select to link to a New Process:\nClick on the down arrow in the Target process field to open a drop-down list of Kianda processes.\nSelect the Kianda process that you want to open when the user clicks on the Link widget. You can type the start of a process name into the field so the drop-down list is filtered to show processes starting with that letter or word.\nIn our example, we will select the ‘Annual leave request and approval process’ as the Target process for our new Link widget; this will mean that a new instance of the ‘Annual Leave request form’ will open when the user clicks on the ‘Start New Process’ Link widget button on the dashboard.\nIf you want the process to open in a pop-up dialog box without the user leaving the dashboard page, select the Show in dialog? checkbox. Otherwise, the user will be brought directly into the first form in the process that you have linked to.\nIf you select to link to a Dashboard, the option below it changes to Target dashboard’:\nClick on the down arrow in the Target dashboard field to open a drop-down-list of Kianda processes.\nSelect the Kianda dashboard that you want to open when the user clicks on the link button.\nIf you select to link to an External website, two options display below it - URL and ‘Open in new window?’:\nInsert the URL you want the user to be brought to when they click on the Link widget.\nSelect the ‘Open in new window?’ checkbox if you want the external website to open in a new window.\nQueryString parameters - Complete this field if you want to pass a query string when the user clicks on the link. For example, you may want the current user’s email address to be pre-populated in a form you are linking to.\nAs an example, let’s say that when the user clicks on the link in the Link widget, you want the First Name field of the new Annual Leave Request form they are brought to to be pre-populated with the name ‘John’.\nTo do this, insert the unique name of that field, as well as the value you want that field to be pre-populated with into the QueryString parameters box - in this case that will be ‘firstName=John’. [The grey text that appears in the QueryString parameters field when you open the dialog box - param1=value1 is just placeholder text.]\nNote: The unique name of a field can be found by selecting the field in the form it is in and clicking on the Edit field button. The field’s unique name can then be copied from the Name (Unique) field.\nIn our example, the unique name of the ‘First Name’ field in the ‘Annual Leave Request’ form is ‘firstName’:\nFor our query string parameter example to work, we now need to add an On load Set form field rule (that is, a rule that is executed when the form is opened that will run a query string to automatically populate a field in the form).\nTo do this, we go to Designer, and add a Set form field rule to execute when the form is loaded. In our example, the rule will set the ‘First Name’ field when the form is loaded:\nOnce the rule has been saved, it can be viewed in the On load rules section of the right side menu when the process is opened:\nTo learn more about the Set form field rule, go to Set form field rule or to learn more about Rules in general, see Rules.\nLink icon - You can choose the icon you want to appear on your Link widget button. Click on the down arrow and select the icon you want to use from the large number of options available.\nText colour - You can choose the colour of the text that appears on the Link widget button. For example, if we choose orange, our Link widget button could look like this:\nLink size - You can choose the width of the Link widget button, from 1 column wide to 12 columns wide. Change the width by clicking on the blue bar.\nLink visible to administrators only? - Select Yes if you want to limit the visibility of this particular link button in the Link widget to Kianda Administrators only.\nLink security (optional) - You can limit visibility of this link button - the ‘Start New Process’ link, in our example - in the Link widget by selecting the user(s) and/or group(s) you want to be able to see it on the dashboard.\nIf you choose ‘Yes’ to the ‘Link visible to administrators only’ option, you could then add in other users (in addition to administrators) who you want to be able to see the link button using this ‘Link security’ option.\nNote: If you have multiple button links in your Link widget, you can limit the users/groups who can view each of the link buttons within that Link widget.\nClick on the OK button when you are finished choosing the options you want for your Link widget (or click on Close to exit the Edit link dialog box without saving).\nYour Link widget will now be displayed on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the insertion of the new widget.\nHow to edit Link Text widgets To edit a Link widget on a dashboard:\nIn the dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to view the page in Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button and Bin/Trash button are available).\nClick on the Link widget’s Update configuration (Edit) button .\nThe Edit button links dialog box opens, enabling you to make whatever changes you want to the link button(s) in the Link widget using the same range of options as outlined in Step 6 of How to get started.\nMaking the changes you want and then click OK.\nThe updated Link widget will be shown on the Dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\nHow to move Link widgets To move a Link widget on a dashboard:\nOn your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode. Select the widget’s drag handle button . Drag and drop the widget where you want it to go on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made. In our example, we could move the new Link widget to the top left of the dashboard:\nHow to delete Link widgets To delete a Link widget from your dashboard:\nOn your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\nClick on the widget’s Remove widget (Bin/Trash icon) button .\nA Delete widget dialog box will open. Click on OK to delete the widget (or click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion).\nClick on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\nHow to edit Link widget settings To update or edit your Link widget settings:\nOn your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\nClick on the Update widget settings (Cog) button .\nThe Edit widget dialog box will open, enabling you to make changes to any of the available options (the same options as were available in the Add widget dialog box discussed in Step 4 of How to get started).\nIn our example, we could choose to reduce the width of the Link widget to be 4 columns wide, by clicking to the left of the existing blue bar.\nClick on OK to confirm the changes you’ve made to the widget settings (or click on Close if you don’t want to retain any changes).\nThe updated Link widget will display on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\nSaving changes Make sure to save any changes you make to your Link widget by clicking on the Save button in the dashboard top menu. If you leave the dashboard without saving the changes you have made to a widget, the next time you visit the dashboard it won’t include any of the changes made to it since the dashboard page was last saved.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about the Dashboard Link widget, find out more about the other types of Dashboard widgets you can add to your Kianda dashboard:\nChart widget Filter widget Rich Text widget List widget Tile widget Walkthrough widget Custom dashboard widget ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"A dashboard Link widget can be used to create a button link on a …","ref":"/docs/platform/pages/link/","tags":"","title":"Link widget"},{"body":"The list widget displays the instances of the selected process in a dashboard.

Rules allow actions based upon conditions resulting from user interaction with fields. Go to Rules to learn about the different categories of rules that can be applied. One such rule that can be used in conjunction with the Dialog field is the Show, hide or disable rule - to learn more, see Show, hide or disable.\nFor example, in a simple Training Request form that employees can complete if they want to request training, it could be useful to insert a Dialog field so that a reminder message pops up when the employee clicks on the Save or Submit buttons, to remind them to check that they have completed all fields before they submit their form. We will keep this example in mind as we learn more about Dialog fields.\nTo view a video example of how to create a Modal dialog field, see How to create a modal dialog.\nHow to get started To add a Modal dialog field to a form, first open the relevant process.\nThen select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible). Go to Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.\nClick on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\nSelect Layout to view the range of Layout controls and click on Dialog. A pop-up message will appear saying ‘Field added’ and a Dialog field will be added to the bottom of your form.\nBy default, the Dialog field will not be displayed in the form to users (as denoted by the eye symbol with the line through it ). This is because, as already mentioned, Dialog fields are typically used in conjunction with a rule being applied to a field or button - such as the Submit or Save buttons - so that the pop-up message is only shown to users in certain circumstances, rather than being displayed in the form all the time.\nIn our example of the Training Request form, we may only want the Dialog to display when the user clicks on either Submit or Save, to remind them to check that they have completed all fields.\nHow to set the heading for the Dialog The title of the Dialog field will display as the heading at the top of the pop-up Dialog message. By default, the title of the new Dialog field is ‘Dialog 1’.\nTo change the title of a Dialog field:\nSelect the new Dialog field (by either clicking on the drag handle or clicking in the area of the Dialog field) so that the Edit field button is visible. Edit the Title in the Field properties panel to the right. For example, we could decide to give our pop-up Dialog message a heading of ‘Reminder’. To learn more about editing the Field properties associated with Modal dialog fields, go to How to edit Modal dialog field properties.\nHow to insert body text for the Dialog To create the body of the pop-up Dialog, you can insert any of the field types from the Controls menu, such as a text box, list, table or richtext. First, select the Dialog field (so that the Edit field button is visible) and then go to the Controls menu and click on the field type you want to insert.\nThe Richtext field is a very flexible option to use for the body of the pop-up message as it gives you the most options - such as formatting and styling the text or inserting images or links. We will use a Richtext field to step through how to add text to the body of the Dialog field for our Training Request form.\nSelect the Dialog field and then insert a Richtext field into it by clicking Controls \u003eLayout \u003eRichtext in the right-hand pane. To learn more about Richtext fields, go to Richtext control.\nA New field - Richtext dialog box will open:\nThe options within the New field - Richtext dialog box include:\nTitle - You can change the title of the Richtext field from the default ‘Richtext 1’. Note: It is the Dialog field title that will show as the heading of the pop-up Dialog, not the Richtext title.\nName - This is a unique name for the field.\nHelptext - You can insert text to help the form user to complete the field - if you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted. This option is not as relevant to the Dialog field as it is to other fields, as the Dialog field is not a field the user needs to complete.\nRichtext - Type the text that you want to be shown as the main body text in the pop-up Dialog into this field and format it as you want - there are options to highlight text, change the font style and font colour, bold, underline, increase or decrease font size, use a bulleted or numbered list, format the text to align left/centre/right, insert a table or a link, insert an image or to switch to code view.\nColour scheme - You can choose from five colour options for the colour that will appear in the background behind the Dialog richtext body text.\nFor our example of the Training Request form, we will insert text to remind the employee completing the form to check that they have completed all fields before submitting it and will choose an orange background colour:\nOnce you have completed the New field - Richtext dialog box, click OK. You will now see the body text of your Dialog field in the Richtext field you added to it:\nTo preview how the pop-up Dialog will look tp users, either click on the Dialog Preview button or click on the eye symbol :\nClick on Close or OK to close the preview.\nHow to edit, move and delete Modal dialog fields As we go through the options available for editing, moving or deleting a Modal dialog field in a form, we will keep in mind our example of the ‘Reminder’ pop-up Dialog in the Training Request form.\nHow to edit a Modal dialog field To edit a Modal dialog field:\nSelect the Dialog field (by either clicking on the drag handle or clicking in the area of the Dialog field)\nThen click on the Edit field button (Pen icon) The Edit field - Dialog dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from a range of options (we already changed the Dialog field title to ‘Reminder’ so this name will be shown in the dialog box name):\nThe options within the Edit field - Dialog dialog box include:\nTitle - You can change the title of the Modal Dialog field here. We already changed it to ‘Reminder’ from the default Dialog 1 in the ‘Title’ field in the Field properties pane.\nName - This is a unique name for the field\nHelp text - You can insert text to help the form user. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted. This option is less relevant for the Dialog field as it is for other field types, as the Dialog field is not a field the user needs to complete.\nHide “OK” button - Select Yes if you do not want the user to see an ‘OK’ button at the bottom of the Dialog message.\nHide “Close” button - Select Yes if you do not want the user to see a ‘Close’ button at the bottom of the Dialog message.\nEnable dismiss (X button right top) - Choosing Yes means an X button (that the user can click on to dismiss the pop-up message) will be shown at the top right of the Dialog.\nDialog size - You can choose from the Default size or Large size for your Dialog message.\nOnce you have finished editing the Dialog field in the Edit field - Dialog dialog box, click on the OK button to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\nTo see how your form or Dialog field will look on a mobile, view it in Mobile preview by using the Preview option which can be opened by clicking the play button icon . You also have the options to see how it will look on a PC or tablet.\nHow to move a Modal dialog field To move a Modal dialog field:\nSelect the field’s Drag handle button Drag and drop it wherever you want to move it within your form\nHow to delete a Modal dialog field To delete a Modal dialog field from your form:\nSelect it (by either clicking on the Panel field’s name or its Drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button Click on OK to confirm the deletion (or click Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion). How to edit Modal dialog field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a Modal dialog field, select the Dialog field (by clicking on the drag handle button or clicking in the area of the Dialog field) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nIn the example shown here, a Dialog field titled ‘Reminder’ has been selected and the Field properties associated with it are shown in the Field properties menu to the right:\nTitle - The title of the Modal Dialog field. In this case, ‘Reminder’. Layout - How wide the Modal Dialog field will be on a PC and mobile phone, denoted by the width of the blue bar. You can change the width by clicking on the blue bar. Saving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about the Modal dialog control, find out more about the other types of Layout fields you can add to a Kianda process:\nField group control Panel layout control Richtext control ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The Modal dialog field allows you to design pop-up dialog messages …","ref":"/docs/platform/controls/layout/dialog/","tags":"","title":"Modal dialog control"},{"body":" Page under construction\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Page under construction\n","ref":"/docs/platform/connectors/mysql/","tags":"","title":"MySql"},{"body":" Page under construction\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Page under construction\n","ref":"/docs/no-code/application-development-life-cycle/","tags":"","title":"No-Code application development life cycle"},{"body":"Getting started with the Kianda platform The Kianda platform no-code / low-code (NCLC) platform is built with the ultimate flexibility and agility in mind.\nAt the software level Kianda follows an MVC approach (Model, View, Controller). This approach enabled the Kianda team to build a flexible way for designers to build mobile responsive applications by using rapid UI prototyping via drag \u0026 drop of forms and fields. This layout serves as the basis for defining the application or process schema and for capturing and reporting on data at run-time.\nSome of the underlying technologies used within the platform include CSS3, HTML5, EmberJS, WebApi and NodeJS.\nUsing a MVC approach allows that data, captured within forms and fields, to instantly react or trigger declarative rules defined on fields, forms or at process level via the rules engine. This combined with conditional logic is used by designers to build ambitious progressive web applications or end-to-end digital business processes that offer both a great UI and high performance.\nIn Kianda one of the most important components that is worth emphasis is the rules engine.\nIn a nutshell the rules-engine is made of: Rule blocks - These are blocks that unlocks specific functionality using a toolkit approach Flexible and declarative conditional logic These two components (rule blocks and conditional logic) are used extensively and recursively by designers to build the required orchestration of actions or rules that react of interact with data to provide the required functionality for your apps or processes.\nIn summary the Kianda platform provides an ideal interface for rapid prototyping and delivering outcomes quickly.\nWhat makes Kianda great is the simplicity and unbounded flexibility it gives citizen developers and low-code developers alike Table of contents ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Getting started with the Kianda platform The Kianda platform no-code / …","ref":"/docs/no-code/nocode-design-principles/","tags":"","title":"No-code design principles"},{"body":" Page under construction\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Page under construction\n","ref":"/docs/no-code/best-practices/","tags":"","title":"No-Code Development Best Practices"},{"body":" Page under construction\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Page under construction\n","ref":"/docs/examples/ncr-app/","tags":"","title":"Non-Conformance Report"},{"body":" Page under construction\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Page under construction\n","ref":"/docs/platform/connectors/office-365/","tags":"","title":"Office 365"},{"body":" Page under construction\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Page under construction\n","ref":"/docs/platform/connectors/oracle-database/","tags":"","title":"Oracle database"},{"body":"When using a predefined dashboard widget, there are many options to enabling filtering, match conditions, and only display certain fields from processes, so you can hone in on the data you need.\nHow to get started Click on the Pen icon in a widget you have created, for example a List widget as shown below.

One advantage of having related fields contained within a panel is that you can then easily move that panel (and all of the fields within it) to another location within your form.\nFor example, in a ‘Training Request’ form, you may decide to insert two panels - one panel to contain the details relating to the employee requesting the training and a second panel to contain the details of the training course being requested.\nHow to get started To add a Panel to a form, first open the relevant process.\nThen select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the Edit Form button is visible). Go to Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.\nInsert the Panel by clicking on Controls in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu.\nSelect Layout to view the range of Layout controls and click on Panel.\nA pop-up message will appear saying ‘Field added’ and a panel field with the default name Panel 1 will be added to your form.\nBy default, the title of the new panel will not be displayed in your form, but you can make it visible by selecting the ‘Show title’ checkbox in the Field properties panel to the right) - to learn more about editing the Field properties associated with Panels, go to How to edit Panel field properties.\nHow to edit, move and delete Panels As we go through the options available for editing a Panel in a form, we will keep in mind the example of adding two panels to a ‘Training Request’ form - one titled ‘Employee Details’ and one titled ‘Training Details’.\nHow to edit a Panel To edit a Panel:\nSelect the field\nClick on the Edit field button (Pen icon) The Edit field - Panel dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from a range of options:\nThe options within the Edit field - Panel dialog box include:\nTitle - You can change the title of the Panel from the default ‘Panel 1’.\nIn our example, after inserting two panels into our form, we could edit each of them in turn and change their titles to ‘Employee Details’ and ‘Training Details’.\nIn order to have the title of a Panel display in your form, you need to take one further step - select each panel and then select the ‘Show title’ checkbox in the Field properties panel to the right. Now the titles of the two Panels will be shown - here we have selected the first panel in order to display the ‘Show title’ checkbox associated with it:\nYou will learn more about the Field properties associated with Panels in How to edit Panel Field properties.\nName (unique) - This is a unique name for the Panel field.\nHelp text - You can insert text to help the form user to complete the Panel.\nIn our example, we could insert this help text to assist the user in completing the ‘Employee Details’ panel:\nIf you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the Panel title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\nLayout columns - Here you can decide how wide you want your Panel to be in your form - choose from 1 to 12 columns in width. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a panel that is 6 columns wide, or click at the far right side of the blue bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.\nColour scheme - You can choose from six different colour options: navy, green, blue, amber, red, white. By default, the colour is set to white.\nEnable panel security - If you want to restrict who can see the contents of the Panel, choose Yes. Two additional options will then be shown - ‘Add security’ and ‘Allow anonymous link’:\nTo limit who can view the Panel contents, click the ‘Add security’ button. A new row is displayed, within which you can select the user(s) or groups who will be able to vie the Panel:\nIn Field security, you can choose from three options in terms of who will be able to view the Panel you are inserting: User or group, User picker field or Form owner(s).\n(i) If you choose to limit the Panel visibility to a ‘User or group’, you can then select the user(s) or groups you want to be able to see it in the ‘Select user(s) or groups’ box.\n(ii) If you choose to limit the Panel visibility to a ‘User picker field’, you then select the User picker field in the ‘Select a userpicker field’ box:\nThis will limit the visibility of the Panel to the user(s) selected in that User picker field.\n(iii) If you choose to limit the Panel visibility to ‘Form owner(s)’, you then select the form in the ‘Select a form’ box - only the owner(s) of the selected form will be able to view the Panel you are inserting:\nThe second main option in terms of Panel security is ‘Allow anonymous link’:\nIf you choose Yes, this will mean that the Panel will be visible when the form is accessed via an anonymous link.\nIf you choose No, anyone accessing the form from an anonymous link will not be able to see the Panel.\nAnonymous links can be useful if, for example, you want members of the public to complete your form without needing to log into Kianda. To learn more about how you can create anonymous links to a form that can be shared with external users, see Anonymous form link.\nOnce you are finished editing the Panel in the Edit field dialog box, click on the OK button to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving. How to add fields to a Panel Once you have inserted a Panel and completed the Edit field - Panel dialog box, you can then start to add the elements you need into the Panel - such as text boxes, lists, tables, number fields or date fields. Go to Controls to see the full list of fields available and Rules to learn about different categories of rules that can be applied.\nTo add fields to your Panel:\nSelect the Panel (by either clicking on the field title or on the field’s Drag handle button ) so that the Edit field button is visible Click on whatever type of field you want to insert from the Controls menu in the left-hand pane. Let’s take the example of our first Panel, titled ‘Employee Details’. To add a Text box field to this Panel we can:\nSelect the Panel by clicking on the ‘Employee Details’ field Drag handle. Click on Controls\u003eInput\u003eText box in the Controls menu to insert a Text box. A pop-up message says ‘Field added’ and a new Text box, titled ‘Text box 1’, is added to the ‘Employee Details’ panel: You can then edit this new Text box field as needed - in our example, we will rename it as ‘First Name’. To learn more about Text box fields, go to Text box control. By adding two text box fields (titled ‘First Name’ and ‘Surname’) and a date field (titled ‘Date of Birth’) to our ‘Employee Details’ Panel, and then adding the fields we need to the ‘Training Details’ Panel, our ‘Training Request’ form - with its two Panels - could look like this when viewed on a user’s mobile phone:\nTo see how your form or field will look on a mobile, view it in Mobile preview by using the Preview option which can be opened by clicking the play button icon . You also have the options to see how it will look on a PC or tablet.\nHow to move a Panel To move a Panel, simply\nSelect the Panel field’s Drag handle button Drag and drop it wherever you want to move it within your form. How to delete a Panel To delete a Panel from your form\nSelect it (by either clicking on the Panel field’s name or its Drag handle button ), click on the Bin/Trash button Click on OK to confirm or click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion. Note: Remember that deleting a Panel will result in all of the fields contained within that Panel also being deleted.\nHow to edit Panel Field properties To view or edit the field properties associated with a Panel, select the Panel field (by clicking on the field title or drag handle button ) - the Field properties menu will appear in the right-hand pane.\nIn the example shown here, the Field properties associated with the ‘Employee Details’ Panel include:\nField type - the type of field. In this case, Panel. Title - the title of the Panel field (default name ‘Panel 1’ unless you change it). In this case, ‘Employee Details’. Show title - this is selected, which means that the Panel title will be shown in the form Visible - this is selected, so the Panel will be visible to form users Layout - the width of the blue bars can be adjusted to change the width of the Richtext field on PC or mobile. To view the mobile width, click on the expand button to the right of the Layout option. To learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about the Panel control, find out more about the other types of Layout fields you can add to a Kianda process:\nField group control Modal dialog control Richtext control ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"A Panel field is section within a form.

Kianda has the ability to perform GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operation if they are supported by the webservice. The REST API datasource can support multiple REST methods, all of which can be called independently. Data from the webservice can be pulled into Kianda and manipulated or data from Kianda can be pushed to the webservice to be used by other systems.\nWhen to use You can create a REST API datasource when you want your Kianda processes and forms to have access to a REST API.\nHow to get started A REST API data connector can be configured by users with the role Administrator or Manage datasources. These users can access the function, found under Administration \u003e Data sources.\nIn the left-hand side menu, go to Administration \u003e Data sources.\nIn the main view you will see any existing data sources that have been created. From this view, you can click on the name of a data source to see details or delete a data source by clicking on the Bin/Trash button .\nTo create a new data source, click on the Add new in the main view. A range of data source connectors will appear.\nTo add a REST Service data source click on REST Service.\nThe REST Service details screen opens.\nFill in the first set of fields:\nDisplay name – This is the name of the data source. Use an appropriate name, as this will be used with your process.\nRest server base URL – This is the base URL of the REST API. Ensure there are no trailing characters, for example https://api.mywebsite.com\nEnable Certificate Authentication – By default this option is set to No. By Selecting Yes this will display two new fields:\nCertificate (.pfx) – This is a file field which you can use to upload your authentication certificate.\nCertificate password – Enter the password of the certificate here so the Kianda platform will be able to use it.\nUnder REST Methods, a list of current REST Methods that have been created in Kianda will appear, listed by Name, Path and HTTP Method. You can edit details of the existing REST Methods by clicking on the Edit/Pen button or delete a REST Method by clicking on the Bin/Trash button.\nTo add a new REST Method to Kianda click on the +Add REST Method button. The REST Method editor dialog box appears.\nFill out the fields:\nDisplay Name – The name you want to attribute to the REST Method. HTTP Method – The HTTP Method of the REST Method. Url Path – This is the rest of the URL that will be concatenated with the Rest server base URL. For example /rest/GetUserDetails Request headers – Request headers can be manually added here that need to be sent as part of the request. For example, Authorization. These values can be hard coded or passed into the Request header from the Process. Request body – This section is for the Request body that will be used during the request. These values can be hard coded or passed into the Request body from the Process. Content type – Here you can define the Content type of the body. The options are JSON and Form Data Response headers – Here you can define any response headers you wish to capture in the response that you want to use in Kianda Response body – Here you can define the response body that the request will receive. Include or remove fields as needed. When you are finished editing the dialog box click on OK to save your changes, or click on Close at any time to exit\nBeneath the REST Methods on the REST Service details page there is a check box to Use Kianda Cloud Connect? - if you check this checkbox it gives you an option to Download Kianda Cloud Connect. Click on Download Kianda Cloud Connect to download a zip file.\nAt the bottom of the REST Service details page there are four buttons:\nTest connection – By clicking this button you verify that the REST server base URL can be reached by Kianda.\nSave – Saves the creation or changes made to the REST Service\nSecurity – Define who can control, use and the level of access your B2B Portals have to the REST Service. See the Data Access page for more details.\nClose – Close the REST Service. Click on this to exit the page without saving.\nTo finalise the connection, click on Test connection first, then click on Security to set security settings, and then click on Save to save your work. The data connector will now appear in the main data sources view.\nNext Steps\nYour REST Service is now set up and ready to be used in your Processes.

It can provide optimum formatting options, such as bold and italics and the option to insert images or links.\nHow to get started To add a Rich Text widget to a dashboard:\nOpen the relevant dashboard page. To learn how to create your first dashboard page, go to How to create a dashboard page.\nFor this example, we’ll open a dashboard page called ‘Annual Leave’ that currently only has a List widget on it:\nClick on the Edit current page button from the top dashboard menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button , Bin/Trash button and Add layout container button are available):\nClick on the Rich Text widget button in the Dashboard Widget menu.\nThe Add widget dialog box opens with a range of options for your new Rich Text widget.\nChoose the options you want:\nTitle - You can insert the title you want for your Rich Text widget. In our example, we’ll call it ‘Information’.\nLayout columns - You can choose how wide you want your Rich Text widget to be. You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click on the right of the blue bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.\nColour scheme - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White).\nShow header - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your Dashboard widget to be shown.\nVisible to - You can determine who will be able to see the Rich Text widget. You can select single or multiple Users or Groups, or a combination of the two. You can select Users or Groups in the right-hand menu so that the options shown in the drop-down list are either individual users or Groups.\nTo find out more about pre-defined Groups on Kianda, go to Users \u0026 Groups.\nNote - Dashboard page security: When a dashboard page is first created, the users(s)/group(s) who will be able to view the dashboard are selected in the ‘Visible to’ option in the Create dashboard page dialog box (see Step 3 in How to create a Dashboard page).\nYou can also edit or update this setting at any point to change who has permission to view a particular dashboard page. This higher dashboard-level security setting will take precedence over the security settings (‘Visible to’) that are applied to the individual widgets within the dashboard (such as the Rich Text widget, in this case).\nSee Dashboard security and Widget security for more information.\nLayout container - This option will only display if you have already created layout containers for your Dashboard page. Here, you can select which layout container you want your new Link widget to be placed in.\nA layout container is a simple way to organise, arrange and move the widgets you add to your dashboard. To learn more about layout containers, go to How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page.\nIn this example, we can select to place our new Rich Text widget into one of three layout containers - Top, Middle or Bottom:\nDevice visibility - You can choose what devices and types of internet connections the dashboard Rich Text widget will be visible on - select all the options you want from Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, Wi-Fi and Flight mode as to when the device can view the dashboards. By default, all options are selected.\nClick on OK when you’ve completed the Add widget dialog box.\nAn Edit content dialog box automatically opens:\nInsert the content you want to appear in your Rich Text widget by using the available options.\nInsert the text you want to appear in the body of the Edit content dialog box. You can choose from an wide array of styles and formats, including: Style, Colour, Bold, Underline, Remove font style, Font size, Font family, Unordered list, Ordered list, Paragraph, and Table.\nYou can also choose to insert a Link or Picture or to switch to Code view (if you click on Code view button you can copy HTML code directly into the text).\nIf you click on Picture an Insert Picture dialog box opens, allowing you to either browse to select an image file or to insert an image URL (as shown here):\nFor our example, we will insert text details relating to the Annual Leave dashboard, format them as we want, and also insert a suitable image:\nClick on the OK button when you are finished inserting the content you want in your Rich Text widget or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\nYour Rich Text widget will now be displayed on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the insertion of the new widget.\nHow to edit Rich Text widgets To edit a Rich Text widget on a dashboard:\nIn the dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to view the page in Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button and Bin/Trash button are available).\nClick on the Rich Text widget’s Update configuration (Edit) button .\nThe Edit content dialog box opens, enabling you to make whatever changes you want to the content of the Rich Text widget using the same range of options as outlined in Step 6 of How to get started.\nMaking the changes you want and then click OK.\nThe updated Rich Text widget will be shown on the Dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\nHow to move Rich Text widgets To move a Rich Text widget on a dashboard:\nOn your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode. Select the widget’s drag handle button . Drag and drop the widget where you want it to go on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made. In our example, we could move the new Rich Text widget to the left of the List widget:\nHow to delete Rich Text widgets To delete a Rich Text widget from your dashboard:\nOn your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\nClick on the widget’s Remove widget (Bin/Trash icon) button .\nA Delete widget dialog box will open. Click on OK to delete the widget (or click on Cancel if you wish to cancel the deletion).\nClick on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\nHow to edit Rich Text widget settings To update or edit your Rich Text widget settings:\nOn your dashboard, click on the Edit current page button in the top menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode.\nClick on the Update widget settings (Cog) button .\nThe Edit widget dialog box will open, enabling you to make changes to any of the available options (the same options as were available in the Create widget dialog box discussed in Step 4 of How to get started).\nIn our example, we could choose to make increase the width of the Rich Text widget to be 7 columns wide, by clicking to the right of the existing blue bar.\nClick on OK to confirm the changes you’ve made to the widget settings (or click on Close if you don’t want to retain any changes).\nThe updated Rich Text widget will display on your dashboard. Click on Save in the dashboard top menu to save the changes you’ve made.\nSaving changes Make sure to save any changes you make to your Rich Text widget by clicking on the Save button in the dashboard top menu. If you leave the dashboard without saving the changes you have made to a widget, the next time you visit the dashboard it won’t include any of the changes made to it since the dashboard page was last saved.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about the Dashboard Rich Text widget, find out more about the other types of Dashboard widget you can add to your Kianda dashboard:\nChart widget Filter widget Link widget List widget Tile widget Walkthrough widget Custom dashboard widget ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"A dashboard Rich Text widget can be used to create custom rich text …","ref":"/docs/platform/pages/richtext/","tags":"","title":"Rich Text widget"},{"body":"Richtext fields can be used to create custom rich text content in forms, such as an attractive banner. They provide optimum formatting options, such as bold and italics, or the option to insert images or links.\nFor example, we may want to insert some colourful headings into a Training Approval form within an Education Request process (where employees can request training in a Training Request form and their manager then either approves or rejects this request in a Training Approval form).\nHow to get started To add a Richtext field to a form, first open the relevant process - in our case, we will open the Education Request process. Go to Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.\nThen select the form within that process to which you want to add the Richtext field (so that the Edit Form button is visible). We will select the ‘Training Approval’ form:\nThe Training Approval form contains two panels (as indicated above), neither of which currently has a heading.

For more information on rules, see Rules.\nEmail connector The email connector must be set up in advance TO COME BACK TO.\nIf you leave the From field empty, the email will be sent from noreply@kianda.com. If you want your email to come from a different sender, follow these steps when you are editing the Send email rule:\nSet Send via connector to Yes. Click into the field under Email connector and select a connector. Click on OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving. Note that this will override the global Email connector setting if one has been configured for your system. Go to Administration \u003e Subscription \u003e Subscription Details to check for a global setting.\nSelection mode When you are filling out the To, From, CC or BCC fields and click on the Person button you have the following selection mode options to choose from: Any user or partner, User(s) defined in a user field, Form owner(s), Email address in a field. Each option is explained below.\nPlease note in all modes you can clear a field by clicking on the field and click on Clear field .\nAny user or partner - if you choose this option, then click on Users and choose from Users, Groups or Partners and click into the field under Select users to see a dropdown list of users, predefined groups and partners and click onto your name of choice. You can add as many users, groups and partners as desired by clicking on a name in the list, or remove by clicking on the name within the field for example HR Team. ​\tClear the field if needed clicking on the field and click on Clear .\nUser(s) defined in a user field - if you choose this option, it means the user name is already defined in a form. Click on User picker button and click into the field under Select a user field to see a user picker field or other field within a form, where the user (email address), for example ‘Line Manager’ is within the form Employee Request Click on the field to add to the list. You can add as many fields as desired by clicking on the User picker button or remove a field by clicking on the field or by clicking on the Bin/Trash button.\nForm owner(s) - if you choose this option, then click click into the field under Form owner of selected form and choose from the forms within that process, where the form owner(s) email addresses will be selected. Email address in a field - if you choose this option, then click into the field under Type the address or select from a field and either type in an email address or choose from a field within a form within that process. In all cases when you have made your selection, click on OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\nExpression builder The expression builder is a useful and efficient way to use existing form fields as part of automated emails that you want to send out.\nFor example if you have a form Annual Leave request that contains a text box field ‘Employee Name’ you can use this field in an automated email to let a manager know that an employee has submitted an a request.\nBefore you begin have your body text inserted into the Body of the email and position your cursor where you want to add an expression, for example an Employee Name after ‘Your employee’ as shown below.\nClick on the Ellipsis button beside email Body then the Expression builder dialog box opens.\nClick into the field under Add field to expression. Forms and fields that are part of your process appear where you can expand elements to drill down to find the field that you want, for example ‘Employee Name’. Click on the field to add field to the expression.\nClick on the Add to expression button to add the field as an expression.\nClick on OK button when you are finished editing to save your changes or click on Close to exit the dialog box without saving.\nThe result is the expression is now part of the automated email.\nTo add more expressions, firstly position your cursor in your body text where you want to add the expression, then click on the Ellipsis button and under Add field to expression clear any existing fields by clicking on the Clear button. This appears when you hover over the Add field box.\nThen search for other fields, for example lists or links, and use the Expression reference functions, see step 7.\nClick on Reference button button to find out how to use particular functions in your email. For example ProcessLink() returns the html link to the current process. Copy this function into the Expression box and click on OK to add the function. Then in the Body type in the text you want associated with this link for example “click here” into the brackets of the function:\nIn this way you can build sophisticated automated emails that provide a link back to a process instance, for example that a manager can view, update or approve. For more information on References and Expressions see Expressions for more information.\nAttachments To attach a file to an automated email, click on the Attach a file button and the Attach file to email dialog box opens.\nAttachments: Files can be attached to the email. First the file must be stored in a File field in one of the forms. Open the Send Email rule and find the File icon in the Body field menu. Click in the File field to find the field where the file is stored. Click on Insert attachment. There is an option to attach a link to the file rather than the file itself.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"This rule sends an email according to a predefined template.

This can be particularly useful in a form that needs to be signed off as part of an approval process.\nFor example, a manager may complete a Performance Plan form for each employee, setting out their Key Performance Areas and goals. It could be useful to add two Signature fields to this form - titled ‘Manager Signature’ and ‘Employee Signature’ - to record the Manager and Employee each signing off on the Performance Plan. We will keep this example in mind as we learn more about using Signature fields.\nHow to get started To add a Signature field to a Kianda form:\nOpen an existing process by going to Administration \u003e Designer in the left side menu and clicking on a process, or create a new process in Designer. See Create First Process to learn how to create your first process.\nOnce you have opened your process, select the form you want to work on (so that the Edit Form button is shown).\nIn this example, we have opened an Employee Appraisal Process and selected a Performance Plan form within it:\nSelect the area within the form where you want to insert the new Signature field(s) - in our example, we want to insert one new Signature field below the ‘For Manager’ table and a second new Signature field below the ‘For Employee’ table in our Performance Plan form:\nClick on Controls in the left-hand pane, and, from the four categories of Controls (Input, Layout, Actions and Custom), click on Actions.\nSelect Signature from the four types of Action fields: Button, Link, Image and Signature:\nA New field - Signature dialog box will automatically open, giving you options for your new Signature field:\nThe options available in the New field - Signature dialog box include:\nTitle - You can change the name of the Signature field from the default ‘Signature 1’. In our example, we can change it to ‘Manager Signature’.\nName (Unique) - This is a unique name for the new field.\nHelp text - You can insert text to help the form user. If you add help text, a question mark icon will appear next to the field title and, if the user clicks on this, they will see the help text you have inserted.\nFor example, we could insert this Help text to go with our new ‘Manager Signature’ Signature field:\nSignature pad height (pixels) - You can choose the height of the signature in pixels. To do this, either manually type in the number of pixels you want the height to be or use the up and down arrows to the right.\nSignature color - You can choose the colour for the signature itself, i.e. the name of the user electronically signing the form. To do this, click on the field and then either\n(i) use the slider to move between colours and click on the palette to choose a particular hue\n(ii) click on the dropper icon and then choose a colour from your open PC window(s)\n(iii) type in the R G B value if you know the colour you want to use\nSignature thickness - Insert a numerical value for how thick you want the signature font to be. By default, this is set to 2.\nStart signing button text - You can choose the text you want to appear on the Signature field button. By default, the text is ‘Start Signing’ but you can change this to whatever you want.\nRe-Sign button text - You can choose the text you want to appear on the ‘Re-Sign’ button. This ‘Re-Sign’ button appears after the user has clicked the Start signing button and completed the dialog box and it enables the user to replace or override the original signature they input. By default, the text is ‘Re-sign’ but you can change this to whatever you want.\nIn our example of adding a Signature field titled ‘Manager Signature’, once the manager has signed, the ‘Re-sign’ button will be shown:\nShow username and signing time - Select Yes to show the Kianda username of the person who has electronically signed with the Signature field and the time they signed at (per the local time settings on the user’s Kianda account).\nRequire user authentication - Select Yes to require user authentication for the user clicking the Signature field button to sign the section/form. If you select Yes, an additional option will display - Authenticate via SSO.\nIf you then choose Yes for authenticating the user via Single Sign-on, an initial pop-up box will appear to check whether the user is signed in and, after clicking on the Signature button a second pop-up will appear to confirm the user’s credentials.\nIf you choose No for Authenticate via SSO, a pop-up appears requiring the user to confirm their login credentials.\nHide sign by textbox - Select Yes if you want to hide the sign by textbox.\nFor example, if we choose Yes for this option for our new ‘Manager Signature’, when the user clicks the ‘Start signing’ button and the pop-up box opens, they will just see an area where they can either choose Signature (with an electronically generated signature) or Draw or Upload (to draw or upload their signature):\nIf we choose No to Hide sign by textbox, when the user clicks Start signing they will see a ‘Sign by’ textbox at the top of the pop-up that appears:\nAllow override sign by - Select Yes if you want to allow override of the signature inserted in the Signature field. If you choose Yes, an additional option will be shown - Default title of sign by:\nIf you select Yes to ‘Allow override sign by’ and then click into the ‘Default title of sign by’ field, you can then select a field to be used to populate the default name in the Signature field. For example, you could select a User picker field within your form as the ‘Default title of sign by’ - this would then mean that the user that is selected in that User picker field will be the default name shown in the Signature field.\nHide default signature tab - Select Yes if you want to hide the default signature tab (where an electronic signature is automatically generated). If you choose Yes, the next option - Auto save signature - will no longer be available to you.\nIn our example, if we select No to hiding the default signature tab, the user will see the electronically generated signature:\nAuto save signature - Select Yes if you want to auto save the signature.\nButton icon - You can choose an icon to appear on your Signature field button (or can opt not to have an icon on it). Click on the down arrow to the right of the field and select the icon you want from several hundred icons in the dropdown list.\nButton color - Choose the colour you want for your Signature field button. The options are Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White.\nSign dialog button text - You can choose the text to appear on the button at the bottom right of the Signature dialog box. By default, the text is ‘OK’ but you can change this to whatever you want.\nOnce you complete the New field - Signature dialog box, click OK and the new Signature field will be added to your form.\nIn our example, if we insert a new Signature field titled ‘Manager Signature’, it will be added to the bottom of the Performance Plan form and look like this:\nBy default, the Title of the new Signature field will not be shown but you can change this by selecting the the field and checking the Show title checkbox in the Field properties menu to the right.\nYou can then click on the new Signature field within the form to see how it will appear to users.\nIn our case, we can click on the ‘Start Signing’ Manager Signature button to see the dialog box that will appear when the form user clicks on it:\nThe user can choose between a system-created Signature or to Draw or Upload their own version. If you click on Draw or Upload you can see how the user can either sign on the dotted line (and click on Clear at any stage to erase a mistake) or click on Upload handwritten signature and browse for a file.\nClick on the OK button to close the dialog box.\nYou may decide to add rules to your Signature field - to learn more about the different categories of rules available, go to Rules. The rules we add will be executed in the order in which they are listed under Rules in the right hand pane. How to edit, move and delete Signature fields To edit a Signature field:\nSelect the Signature field (by either clicking on the field name or on the field’s drag handle button )\nClick on the Edit Field button (Pen icon) The Edit Field dialog box will open (with the Signature field title you chose reflected in the dialog box name), enabling you to choose from the same range of options as appear in the New field - Signature dialog box (as already discussed in How to get started).\nTo move a Signature field, simply:\nSelect the Signature field’s Drag handle button Drag and drop the Signature field wherever you want to move it within your form.\nFor example, we can move the ‘Employee Signature’ Signature field from where it was automatically added at the bottom of the panel to the location where we want it to go:\nIn our example, if we moved the two Signature fields we inserted in the Performance Plan form - one titled ‘Manager Signature’ and a second titled ‘Employee Signature’ - to go under the ‘For Manager’ and ‘For Employee’ sections, they could look like this:\nTo delete a Signature field from your form:\nSelect the Signature field (by either clicking on the field’s title or its drag handle button ) Click on the Bin/Trash button Click on OK to confirm. How to view and edit Signature field properties To view or edit a Signature control’s Field properties:\nSelect the Signature field (by either clicking on the field title or drag handle button ).\nThe Field Properties associated with the Signature field will be displayed (and can be changed) in the Field properties menu to the right.\nFor example, the Field Properties associated with a Signature field titled ‘Manager Signature’ are shown here and include:\nField type - The type of field, in this case a Signature field. Title - The Title of the field, in this case ‘Manager Signature’. Show title - If this is selected, the Signature field title will be shown in the form. Required - If this is selected, the Signature field will be mandatory for the form user. Enabled - If this is selected, the user will be able to edit or interact with the field. Visible - If this is selected, the Signature field will be visible in the form. Layout - The width of the blue bar can be adjusted to change the width of the Signature field as it appears on a PC or mobile phone (to view the Mobile layout, click on the expand button to the right). ​\tFor more details, go to Field Properties.\nSaving changes and version history Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the Save button . You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the Design Version History button in the top right corner.\nWhat’s next Now that you’ve learned about the Signature control, find out more about the other types of Action fields you can add to Kianda forms:\nButton control\nImage control\nLink controls\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"A Signature control can be used in a form to capture a user’s …","ref":"/docs/platform/controls/actions/signature/","tags":"","title":"Signature control"},{"body":"In this example we will step through how to create a simple Inspection process made up of two forms:\na Request form which is completed by a company employee, requesting an engineer to visit a specific location to perform an inspection an Inspection form which contains the inspection checklist that the engineer must complete The result at the end of the process is an email to a designated Safety manager, who receives a PDF report of the inspection form.\nThe process will use utility panels to hold form fields and values, not visible to the end user, but these will be used with rules to automate the process.\nHow to get started You can create an Inspection process if you have the role Administrator or Designer by going to the left-hand side menu and click on Administration and Designer.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"In this example we will step through how to create a simple Inspection …","ref":"/docs/examples/inspection-app/","tags":"","title":"Simple Inspection process"},{"body":" Page under construction\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Page under construction\n","ref":"/docs/platform/rules/tables/sort-table/","tags":"","title":"Sort table"},{"body":" Page under construction\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Page under construction\n","ref":"/docs/platform/connectors/sql-server/","tags":"","title":"SQL Server connector"},{"body":"This rule allows you to start a new instance of a different process (or a new instance of the same process).

To learn how to create your first dashboard page, go to How to create a dashboard page.\nFor this example, we’ll open a dashboard page called ‘All Procurement’ that has several widgets on it displaying various information relating to a procurement process.\nClick on the Edit current page button from the top dashboard menu to go into Dashboard Edit mode (in which the Widget menu, Settings button , Bin/Trash button and Add layout container button are available):\nClick on the Walk-through widget button in the Dashboard Widget menu.\nThe Add widget dialog box opens with a range of options for your new Walk-through widget.\nChoose the options you want:\nTitle - You can insert the title you want for your Walk-through widget (instead of the default title shown). In our example, we’ll call it ‘Procurement Walk through’.\nLayout columns - You can choose how wide you want your Walk-through widget to be. You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click to the very end of the bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.\nColour scheme - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White), if you choose to display it.\nShow header - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your Dashboard widget to be shown. This checkbox is not selected by default, so select it if you want the widget header to be displayed.\nVisible to - You can choose who will be able to see the Walk-through widget. You can select single or multiple Users or Groups, or a combination of the two. Use the menu on the right to filter the drop-down list by Users or Groups. To find out more about pre-defined Groups on Kianda, go to Users \u0026 Groups.\nNote - Dashboard page security: When a dashboard page is first created, the users(s)/group(s) who will be able to view the dashboard are selected in the ‘Visible to’ option in the Create dashboard page dialog box (see Step 3 in How to create a Dashboard page).\nYou can also edit or update this setting at any point to change who has permission to view a particular dashboard page. This higher dashboard-level security setting will take precedence over the security settings (‘Visible to’) that are applied to the individual widgets within the dashboard (such as the Walk-through widget, in this case).\nSee Dashboard security and Widget security for more information.\nLayout container: This option will only display if you have already created layout containers for your Dashboard page. Here, you can select the layout container you want to place your new Walk-through widget in.\nA layout container is a simple way to organise, arrange and move the widgets you add to your dashboard. To learn more about layout containers, go to How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page.\nIn this example, we can select to place our new Walk-through widget into one of three layout containers - Top, Middle or Bottom:\nDevice visibility - You can choose what devices and types of internet connections the dashboard Walk-through widget will be visible on - select all the options you want from Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, Wi-Fi and Flight mode as to when the device can view the dashboards. By default, all options are selected.\nClick on OK when you’ve completed the Add widget dialog box.\nA Walk-through steps dialog box automatically opens showing the options for the Walk-through widget:\nSelect the options you want for your Walk-through widget:\nTitle - You can give your Walk-through a title. In our example, we’ll call it ‘Procurement Walk-through’.\nWalk-through steps - This is where you can add all of the individual walk-through steps that you want to bring the user through.\nTo add your first walk-through step:\nClick on the Add step button.\nThe Edit step dialog box opens, allowing you to choose from a range of options for your walk-through step.\nOnce you’ve completed the options in the Edit step dialog box, click OK to add the step to the Walk-through steps dialog box.\nRepeat these three steps to add as many steps as you want to your Walk-through widget.\nThe options for the first step in your Walk-through widget in the Edit step dialog box include:\nTitle - Insert a title for this walk-through step. In our example, we’ll title our first step ‘Welcome step’.\nStep type - You have a choice of three step types: Popup, App Navigation and Element click.\na. A Popup step is a pop-up dialog box containing whatever content you choose to display (including texts, links or pictures).\nb. An App Navigation step brings the user to a new URL - for example, it could bring them into the first form of a process.\nc. An Element click step shows the result of clicking on one of the elements in the dashboard.\nPopup Steps If you choose Popup as the step type, you can then complete the Popup content box to insert the content you want to appear in the pop-up walk-through step, including text, images or links.\nYou can choose from an wide array of styles and formats, including: Style, Colour, Bold, Underline, Remove font style, Font size, Font family, Unordered list, Ordered list, Paragraph, Table, Link, Picture, Code view (which allows you to switch to a code view of the step content) and Help (which displays a range of shortcut keys for different formatting options).\nIn our example, we will make the first step of our walk-through a Popup and will insert the content we want to appear:\nExample - Pop-up step This first Popup walk-through step could look like this to the end user when they click on the Procurement Walk-through widget:\nThe Element selector field at the bottom of the Edit step dialog box can be used if you want an element on the page to be highlighted, to show the user where they need to click.\nWe could add a second step in our walk-through to be another pop-up that explains that the user should click the ‘New Procurement Process’ button to start a new procurement process. This time we can add an Element selector so that the button is highlighted during this step.\nHow to find the name of an element to insert Right-click on the element on the page that you want to higlight.\nIn our case, we right-click on the New Procurement Process link button on the dashboard (as this is what we want to highlight during this step of the walk-through).\nClick Inspect.\nCopy the element you want to be highlighted in this walk-through step.
