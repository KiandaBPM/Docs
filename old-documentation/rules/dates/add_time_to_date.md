FROM HELP??
With the Dates rules, it is easy to manipulate dates! On the example, we are dynamically calculating the starting date of a new employee, with an on-load rule. The starting date will be within 20 days from the registration day (today), excluding a special date. To do so:

You can add a condition to this rule
Click on the form name, on the top of the page, to open the on load rules
Navigate to Dates > Add time to a date
Give the rule a title
Set the amount of time you want to add to the date - 20 days in this case
On to date, select the date you want to add the time to - it can be a date specified in a date field in your form
Add the destination field where the result will be displayed
Add the special dates - days you want to exclude from your addition
Save and press ok
Note: If you are adding hours or minutes to a date, you can limit the day with the business hours option - ie.: 09:00 to 17:00.
