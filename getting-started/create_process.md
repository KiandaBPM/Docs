# Create your Kianda process #
You can create an end-to-end process quickly and simply in Kianda and use this prototype to develop your ideas through an iterative process. This **agile approach** results in significantly faster development time, that is cost effective and reduces risk.

***Agile development cycle***

![Agile approach](images/agile.png)

The main phases of an agile project are:

1. Planning - this involves determining the scope of the project, what is it you want to achieve and what end-users will be supported and how. The outcome will be a list of requirements that can be adjusted as the process is developed.
2. Design - this involves construction of a draft of your product. Previewing the draft is included in this phase and there may be several rounds of revisions. 
3. Launch - this phase includes piloting the product with a number of users, monitoring results, getting feedback and then releasing the product including all related documentation.

Mapping these phases to process creation in Kianda, results in three main steps: **Plan > Design > Publish**. Each step contains three substeps as outlined below.



## Creating your Kianda processes in an agile way ##

***Three steps to create a process***

Using Kianda allows you to leverage the agile development process to maximum effect:

1. **Plan** - our documentation will guide you when it's time for you to capture your requirements.

   ![A](images/greena.png) What **forms** and **fields** do you need in your process based on what you want to do?

   ![B](images/greenb.png) What **rules** can be applied to create smart, automated processes?

   ![C](images/greenc.png) Who needs **access** to the forms as a user and form owner? Review these questions as you modify the process.
 </br>  

 2. **Design** - you can create drafts processes and restore to earlier versions allowing you complete control over production.

    ![A](images/a.png) Processes are made up of interactive **forms** which you can create at the click of a button.

    ![B](images/b.png) Forms connect to your **datasources** so as your organisation changes, your processes respond accordingly.

    ![C](images/c.png) Use the in-built **previewer** to preview and test your design, then save new versions as you modify design.
</br>

3. **Publish** - expand access to published processes as you become comfortable with the design.

   ![A](images/bluea.png) Allow individual user, group or partner access in order to **deploy** the solution in a controlled way.

   ![B](images/blueb.png) View key metrics in process **dashboards** to get insights into how to improve the process and the organisation.

   ![C](images/bluec.png) **Launch** and release the process, including documentation which can feed into future development projects.
   
   


### What's next  ![Idea icon](images/18.png) ###

Now that you are familiar with the development cycle, you can start to develop your Kianda process following the steps below:

![1](images/one.png)  [**Plan your process**](getting-started/plan_process.md) 

![2](images/two.png)  [**Design and build your process**](getting-started/design_process.md) - start here if you already have your requirements mapped out

![3](images/three.png)  [**Publish your process**](getting-started/publish_process.md)

If you have coding experience and want to delve straight into how you can use Kianda to create your own widgets, go to [**Developer**](getting-started/low_code.md#how-to-get-started-with-developer) to learn more.
