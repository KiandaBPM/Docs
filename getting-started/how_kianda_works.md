#  How Kianda works

The Kianda platform no-code / low-code (NCLC) platform is created with the ultimate flexibility and agility in mind, allowing simple user interactions to build complex processes.

Kianda has been constructed using an **Model, View, Controller (MVC) approach**. This approach allows designers to build mobile-responsive applications via **rapid User Interface (UI) prototyping**. The UI provides an easy way to build an application by clicking, scrolling, and drag and drop of fields. The layout both provides a way to both build the application or process schema, and to capture and monitor data at run-time.



## What's under the 'hood'?

The MVC approach enables user or system-supplied data captured through fields within forms, to react or trigger defined rules associated with fields, forms or processes, via the **rules engine**. 

### The **rules-engine** is made of:

1. Rule blocks - these are blocks that unlock specific functionality using a toolkit approach
2. Flexible and declarative conditional logic 

These two components (rule blocks and conditional logic) are used extensively and recursively by designers to build the required orchestration of actions or rules that interact with data to provide the required functionality for your apps or processes.

The rules engine, combined with conditional logic enables designers to build ambitious, progressive web applications or end-to-end digital business processes that offer both a great UI and high performance.

In addition to the rules engine, CSS3, HTML5, EmberJS, WebApi and NodeJS are some of the underlying technologies used within the platform.

> ### What makes Kianda great is the simplicity and unbounded flexibility it gives citizen developers and low-code developers alike
