# Connect your data #

Connecting your data to Kianda processes, allows real-time scalability, so as your organisation grows, the processes you have created continue to perform, providing sustainable, flexible growth. Your data may be held in **datasources** like SharePoint, Salesforce or SAP. Kianda comes with 19 predefined **data connectors** allowing you to connect to these datasources, see [data connector list](#data-connector-list) for a full listing.

If you are a developer and want to connect to a datasource that is not included in the predefined set, you can use SOAP or REST to create your own API for data transfer.

Connecting to data happens during the **process design** phase, see image below.

***Design process***

You can set up data connectors first, before building your process if you wish, and then link those data connectors when [adding controls and rules](getting-started/create_process/add_form_elements.md).

The video below highlights how to connect to a datasource, in this example, SharePoint and [How to get started](#how-to-get-started.md) runs through the process in steps including an example of how to use this datasource in a list field.

## How to get started ##

In this example, we will connect to a SharePoint list called 'Types of Training' to use a List field in a form called 'Training Request'. We will then show how to add the list field to a form to use the information from the data connector.

1. To connect to a datasource, go to the **Side menu** > **Administration** > **Data sources**.

1. Click on **+ Add new** button ![Add new data connector button](../images/addnew.png) and **SharePoint**.

1. Fill out **Site URL** and choose from options like **SharePoint version**, **Scope** as in, if its a Site or Site Collection and **Authentication mode**. For example, if you choose **System User Credentials** as an authentication mode, you must provide your SharePoint system username and password.

1. Click on **Test connection** and then **Save**.

1. From here we can add a list field called Type of Training, and choose **Data source** as a List source.

6. Click on the **Datasource** button ![Datasource button](../images/datasource.png) and choose the appropriate datasource, in this case a SharePoint list called Training Site. Choose the appropriate **Display field**, **Value field** and choose a field to **Sort by**.

7. The result is a dropdown list called Types of training which is available for use in our Training Request Form.

7. When your form is complete, click on the **Save** button  ![Save button](../images/save.png) to save your work.

The end result is a complete process that is ready for test and review. Go to [Preview the design](getting-started/create_process/previewer.md) to find out how to perform these steps.
