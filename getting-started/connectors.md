# Data connectors

Connecting to data in Kianda is a breeze. You can quickly connect to a data source, for example data in Salesforce, and use this in Kianda forms and dashboards, creating a **data connector**. 

Kianda comes with a predefined set of data connectors, these include:

- Active Directory
- DocuSign
- Dropbox
- Email
- File system
- FTP
- Google Drive
- MySQL
- Office 365
- Oracle
- Powershell
- Salesforce
- SAP
- SharePoint
- SQL
- Web services


If you have a data source that is not on the list above, you can use SOAP or REST to easily connect to your data source.
