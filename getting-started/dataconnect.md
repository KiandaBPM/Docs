# Connect your data #

Connecting your data to Kianda processes, allows real-time scalability, so as your organisation grows, the processes you have created continue to perform, providing sustainable, flexible growth. Your data may be held in **datasources** like SharePoint, Salesforce or SAP. Kianda comes with 19 predefined [**data connectors**](connectors/readme.md), allowing you to connect to these datasources.  

If you are a developer and want to connect to a datasource that is not included in the predefined set, you can use SOAP or REST to create your own API for data transfer.

The video below highlights how to connect to a datasource, in this example, SharePoint.
