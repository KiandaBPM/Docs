# Create a form #

Once you have created a process, you are in the design page.

There are 3 key areas:

1) Left-hand area is used to add form elements like **controls** and **rules**.
2) Central **form canvas** displays the current form you are working on.
3) Right-hand area is used to view and edit process, form and field **properties**.
