# Add forms #

When your process is created, you are automatically in **Kianda Designer**. This page allows you to add and edit forms, add elements to those forms like Controls and Rules, to save, publish and preview forms and view and edit form and field properties.

Kianda Designer has 3 key areas:

1. Left-hand area is used to add form elements like **controls** and **rules**.

2. Central **form canvas** displays the current form you are working on.

3. Right-hand area is used to view and edit process, form and field **properties**.

***Kianda Designer***

**Note**: By default a first form, "form1", is added to your process. Click on the **Pen** button  ![Pen button](images/penicon.png) to start editing this form to make it your own.



## Before you begin ![Process plan icon](images/11.png) 

Once your process is created, you need to reference your [process plan](getting-started/plan_process.md) and consider **what forms** you need and **who** will have access to these forms as an administrator. We will keep our Training Process [requirements](getting-started/plan_process.md#summary-of-requirements) in mind as we go.

In our example we will create two forms: Training Request Form and a Training Approval Form.



## How to get started

1. Click on the **Pen** button  ![Pen button](images/penicon.png) to edit 'form1'.
2. Fill out the details in the **Edit form** dialog box - that is **Title**, **Name**, and **Default owner(s)**, people who will be able to administrate this form, choose from **Users** or **Groups**. There are other options like **Form theme** which are colours that you can apply to the form tab. These options are explained in further details in [Designer](platform/form_designer2.md). Click on **OK** button ![OK button](images/ok.png) when complete.
