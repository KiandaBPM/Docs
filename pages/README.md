# Dashboards #

Kianda **dashboards** deliver a convenient way to provide insights into how your business processes are performing. Kianda dashboards offer easy reporting, permissions management, quick build, condition-based filtering and many more features.

From lists to tiles, filter and charts, dashboards allow you to build full digital experiences to monitor your real-time processes in a few minutes. 

There are 3 steps involved in creating a dashboard:

1. Create a dashboard page.
2. Add one or more widgets.
3. Configure or edit the widgets to make the page look the way you want.

If you are using Kianda predefined processes from the [App Store](#platform/appstore.md) then dashboards have already been created for you! These are  available by clicking on **Dashboard** from the main side menu or left-hand pane.

Before you begin it is important to be aware that there are two modes involved in dashboard pages, an [Edit mode and View mode](#edit-mode-and-view-mode) as described below.



## Edit mode and View mode ##

When using dashboards there are two modes: **Edit mode** and **View mode**.

When you are in **View mode**, the **Edit** button ![Edit button](images/edit.png) will be visible in the top menu bar.

When you click on the **Edit** button ![Edit button](images/edit.png) you will be in **Edit mode**, which means that the **Widget menu** is available at the top of the dashboard page, along with the **Settings** button ![Settings](images/settings.png) to make changes to the page, and **Bin/Trash** button ![Bin button](images/binicon.png) to delete the page.

In **Edit mode,** you can also make changes to widgets, for example Kianda predefined dashboards from the [App Store](#platform/appstore.md) as **Update configuration** ![Pen button](images/pen.png), **Settings** ![Cog button](images/cog.png)and **Delete** ![Bin button](images/bin.png) buttons, will be available. If you want to create a dashboard page from scratch go to [How to get started](#how-to-get-started) or if you want to learn more about dashboard widgets go to [Dashboard widgets](#dashboard-widgets).

### Dashboard widgets ###

Kianda comes with 7 predefined widgets as listed below. Using these widgets you can quickly and easily create a process dashboard in minutes. The widgets are:

- **Rich text**: The Rich text is used to display some texts, links or images on the dashboards.

- **Tile**: A tile is used to display a count of instances with different colour schemes. You could also add conditions to display count, for example, you could add a condition “Status” equals “In-progress”, this will display the count of instances with status “In-progress”, see [Tile widget](pages/tile.md) for more details.

- **Chart:** Using a chart widget, you could create a pie chart, bar chart or a line chart. These charts could be used to represent various conditions on a process, see [Chart widget](pages/chart.md) for more details.

- **List:** The list widget displays the instances of the selected process. List widget could also be used to connect with any other widget to display the filtered items, see [List widget](pages/list.md) for more details.

- **Filter:** The filter widget is used to filter the instances based on a field. For example, process instances could be filtered by status, see [Filter widget](pages/filter.md) for more details.

- **Link:** The link widget is used to add a link to a new process, dashboard or any external sources such as SharePoint, see [Link widget](pages/link.md) for more details.

- **Walk-through:** This widget allows you to create a walk-through quickly which could be made available to a user, group or an organisation, see [Walk through widget](pages/walkthrough.md) for more details.

When you have added one or more widgets, you can move the widgets around the dashboard page using the **Drag handle** button. This is possible when you are in **Edit mode**, see [Edit mode and View mode](#edit-mode-and-view-mode).
