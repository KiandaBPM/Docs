## Introduction

As an end user, when you login to Kianda, you are presented with dashboards and widgets for different processes. The dashboard is made of multiple widgets like tiles, charts, links and lists. Go to [Dashboard](/docs/platform/pages/) to find out more about each widget type.

The workspace level security can only be applied if you have the **Administrator** role to allow visibility of **dashboards and widgets.**

These are the steps involved in applying security to the dashboards:

1. Go to the existing **dashboard** page.

2. Click the **Edit** button ![Edit button](/images/edit.png) visible in the top menu bar.
