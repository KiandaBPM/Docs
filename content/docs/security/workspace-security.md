## Introduction

As an end user, when you login to Kianda, you are presented with dashboards and widgets for different processes. The dashboard is made of multiple widgets like tiles, charts, links etc. Go to Dashboard widgets to find out more about each widget type.

The workspace here refers to the dashboards and widgets, where the user can view the information in order to view or update any record.

The workspace level security can only be applied if you have the Administrator role to set visibility to the **dashboards and widgets.**

These are the steps involved in applying security to the dashboards:

1. Go to the existing **dashboard** page.

2. Click the **Edit** button ![Edit button](/../content/docs/security/workspace-security.assets/clip_image004.png) visible in the top menu bar.
3. Now in **edit mode**, **settings** button is visible. Click on it.

4. “Edit dashboard page” dialog appears where you can find the **Visible to** user picker with an option to select users or groups**.** 

5. Select the correct **users or groups** and click on **Ok**. 

6. Save the changes you make by clicking on the **Save** button

Similarly, you can set the visibility to an individual widget on the dashboard like tile, chart, etc. For example, if you want the dashboard to be visible to everyone and a particular chart on the dashboard only visible to management. This can be achieved by setting the **visible to** field to the management group as shown below.

These are the steps involved in applying security to the widgets:

1. Go to the existing **dashboard** page.

2. Click the **Edit** button ![Edit button](/../content/docs/security/workspace-security.assets/clip_image004.png) visible in the top menu bar.

3. Now in **edit mode**, click on the gear ⚙ icon of the widget.

4. “Edit widget” dialog appears where you can find the **Visible to** user picker with an option to select users or groups**.** 

5. Select the correct **users or groups** and click on **Ok**. 

6. Save the changes you make by clicking on the **Save** button.
