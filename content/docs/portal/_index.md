As a **subscription owner** you will gain access to the portal at **portal.kianda.com**. The portal subscription is created in mind of all **subscription owners** where they can manage their own subscription environments. A subscription owner is one individual which is the main owner of a Kianda subscription. 

Each subscription gets a **Production** environment along with two extra ones, the **Development** and **Quality Assurance** environments. Portal is used to manage those environments by allowing you to transfer assets such as processes, dashboards and widgets from one environment to another. 

## Production Environment

Production is used as the main environment by your employees. They will be able to use process designs which are working to your standards and that match all your process requirements. The users of this environment also will be able to view dashboards which represent data from your processes.

## Development Environment

The Dev environment is used as your testing grounds, here your will be able to start developing new process designs, new dashboards and new widgets. You can also experiment and learn with how kianda works, update or make changes to any existing process designs.  

## Quality Assurance Environment

The QA environment is used by a certain amount of your employees which will use the newly created process designs, dashboards and widgets made in the Dev environment. The employees will be able to test the flow in new processes, see if dashboards display correct information and check if widgets are working in the correct way. When those tests are complete and no issues are found, you can push all assets into the Production environment.
