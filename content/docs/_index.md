The Kianda platform is a modern **low-code** and **no-code** **development platform** providing citizen developers a modern way to digitise business **processes** and build no-code or low-code elegant mobile-ready web applications. You can also use the platform to create simple forms that can quickly evolve into an end-to-end process complete with multiple integrations task automation and real-time process monitoring. 

**Dashboards** enable an easy way to monitor how processes are performing and gain key insights to improve your business overall. As a citizen developer you can **customise** any components provided by the platform to best suit your needs. However if you have coding experience, you can use the platform to build your own widgets too. 

In summary the Kianda platform provides an ideal interface for **rapid prototyping** and delivering outcomes quickly.

## No-code and low-code development with Kianda

Kianda saves your organisation time and resources. Following a short onboarding, you can assign any employee to build web applications for your business, without the need for any coding experience. **No-code** literally means just that, you don't need to know how to code to build digital processes. Anyone is empowered to create. The Kianda platform allows you to create a prototype quickly and simply by clicking and scrolling in an easy-to-use interface. 

For those that have coding experience, Kianda's open, extensible architecture allows a **low-code** approach, meaning you can use the Kianda graphical user interface to extend the range of applications to create what you want using your own code. This type of reusability, leveraging existing templates to build applications, reduces the turnaround time, improving organisational productivity.

The flexible nature of Kianda allowing custom-coding and no-coding development provides the optimum solution for your business, but don't just take our word on it, see what our customers have to say:
