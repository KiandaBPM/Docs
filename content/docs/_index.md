The Kianda platform is a modern **low-code** and **no-code** **development platform** providing anyone, even those without coding experience, the structures to digitise business **processes** resulting in beautiful mobile-ready web applications. You can also use the platform to create **dashboards** to monitor how processes are performing and gain key insights to improve your business overall. And you can **customise** all of this the way you want - no developer needed. However if you have coding experience, you can use the platform to build your own widgets too. 

In summary the Kianda platform provides an ideal interface for **rapid prototyping** and delivering outcomes quickly.

INSERT VIDEO SHOWING WHAT KIANDA IS



## What is no-code and low-code development

Kianda saves your organisation time and resources. Following a short onboarding, you can assign any employee to build web applications for your business, without the need for any coding experience. **No-code** literally means just that, you don't need to know how to code to build digital processes. Anyone is empowered to create. The Kianda platform allows you to create a prototype quickly and simply by clicking and scrolling in an easy-to-use interface. 

For those that have coding experience, Kianda's open, extensible architecture allows a **low-code** approach, meaning you can use the Kianda graphical user interface to extend the range of applications to create what you want using your own code. This type of reusability, leveraging existing templates to build applications, reduces the turnaround time, improving organisational productivity.

The flexible nature of Kianda allowing custom-coding and no-coding development provides the optimum solution for your business, but don't just take our word on it, see what our customers have to say:

## Logging into Kianda ##

If your organisation already has a login, go to your given Kianda login page. If not, sign up for a free trial by going to https://portal.kianda.com/public/signup. You will be prompted to confirm your email address and you can then login. The Kianda platform runs in the cloud, so you only need a web browser and can use any mobile device to login. 

When you login you will have access to the Kianda **workspace** where you can build end-to-end business processes, connect to datasources and view the results in real-time data dashboards.  

![User interface](images/workspace.png)

The layout of the Kianda workspace is as follows:

1. **Company logo** - the top left-hand corner is reserved for uploading your company logos. If you click on the **Collapse navigation** button ![Collapse navigation button](images/navigation_frame.png) you will see the collapsed version of the company logo and collapsed side menu, giving you more real estate in the central view panel.

2. **Side menu** - This left-hand pane contains all the key functions to create and manage your business processes. From this menu you will start **creating** **processes**. In the side menu, under **More**, there are links to get **Help**, **Support**, and give **Feedback**. From this menu you can also developer your own widgets, see [Developer](developer.md) for more details.

3. **Main view** - this central panel is the main view for any of the functions chosen from the side menu. Here you can **view and edit** processes and dashboards.

4. **Quick Action menu** - the top right-hand menu bar contains shortcuts to keep you updated and allows you to **add dashboard pages**.

Go to [Personalise your workspace](workspacepersonalise.md) to find out to change the look and feel as well as regional settings for your workspace.




> Now that you are familiar with the workspace layout, there are **3 steps to producing your first business process** in Kianda:
> 1. [**Plan** your process](processplan.md)
> 2. [**Design** and build your process](processdesign.md)
> 3. [**Publish** your process](processpublish.md)

If you don't want to start from scratch, choose **Kianda's process templates**, found in the [App Store](kiandaapps.md), where we in Kianda have done all the hard work for you. 

If you have coding experience and want to delve into how you can use Kianda to create your own widgets, go to [Developer](developer.md) to learn more.
