## Kianda is a no-code and low-code development platform

Kianda saves your organisation time and resources. Following a short onboarding, any employee can be assigned to build web applications for your business, without the need for any coding experience. **No-code** literally means just that - you don't need to know how to code to build digital processes in Kianda. Anyone is empowered to create. Using Kianda, you can create a prototype quickly and simply in an easy-to-use interface. 

For those who have coding experience, Kianda's open, extensible architecture allows a **low-code** approach, meaning you can use the graphical user interface to extend the range of applications to create what you want, using your own code. This type of reusability, leveraging existing templates to build applications, reduces turnaround time and improves organisational productivity.

The flexible nature of Kianda allows custom-coding and no-coding development, providing the optimum solution for your business.
