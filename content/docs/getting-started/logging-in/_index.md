If your organisation already has a login, go to your given Kianda login page. You will be prompted to confirm your email address and then you can log in. The Kianda platform runs in the cloud, so you only need a web browser to use it and can use any mobile device to log in. 

When you log in, you will have access to the Kianda **workspace** where you can build end-to-end business processes, connect to data sources and view the results in real-time data dashboards.  

***Kianda workspace***

![User interface](/images/workspace4.gif)

The layout of the Kianda workspace is as follows:

1. **Company logo** - the top left-hand corner is reserved for uploading company logos. If you click on the **Collapse navigation** button ![Collapse navigation button](/images/navigation_frame_copy.png) you will see the collapsed version of the company logo and collapsed side menu, giving you more real estate in the central view panel.
2. **Side menu** - Beneath the logo is the left-hand pane, the side menu, containing all of the key functions you need to create and manage your business processes. From this menu you will start **creating** **processes**. In this left side menu, under **More**, there are links to get **Help**, **Support**, and give **Feedback** and under **Administration** you can choose **Developer** to develop your own widgets (see [Developer](/docs/getting-started/welcome/low-code/) for more details).
3. **Quick Action menu** - the top right-hand menu bar contains shortcuts to keep you updated and allows you to **add dashboard pages**.
4. **Main view** - the central view panel is the main view for any of the functions chosen from the side menu. Here you can **view and edit** processes and dashboards.

Go to [Personalise your workspace](/docs/getting-started/logging-in/personalise-workspace/) to find out how to change the look and feel of your workspace and to set regional settings.
