When you log in to Kianda for the first time, a wizard opens allowing you to change the look and feel of your workspace, and to manage regional and mobile app settings. There are four sections within the wizard. 

We will now go through each of these four sections of the wizard for a sample company called 'GreenITR'.



## Look and feel 

1. Click on **Browse** to upload your company logos, for both a full logo and collapsed size logo. 

   **Note:** Recommended size for a **full-size logo** is **200 x 65px** and **45 x  45px** for a **collapsed logo**.

2. Click on a colour scheme under **Themes** and preview the results under **Workspace preview** on the right.
