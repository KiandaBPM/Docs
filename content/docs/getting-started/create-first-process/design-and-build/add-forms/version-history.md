The **current or active version** of a process is always visible in the right-hand pane, for example V0.8 for the process as shown below.

***Process version***![Process version history](/images/versionhistory.png)

The **first version** of a process is **0.1** and will increment to 0.2 and so on, each time a process is saved. Once the process is **published** the version changes to **1.0** and increments with each publication. This makes it is easy to keep track of who made changes and when, and to restore an older version if needed. 

The video below introduces version control and the section [How to get started](#how-to-get-started) runs through how to view process versions and restore an older version.

## How to get started ##

1. To view the version history click on the **Design version history** button which may look like V0.1 or whatever the current version is for your process, for example ![View design version history](/images/version1.png) or ![Version 0.8](/images/version8.png)

2. A pop-up shows the version history details including when the version was created and who created it. 

   In the example below, there are 8 versions of the process, all are **drafts** indicated by the 0 in front, such as 0.8.
