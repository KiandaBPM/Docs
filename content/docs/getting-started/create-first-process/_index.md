You can create an end-to-end process quickly and simply in Kianda and then use this prototype to develop your ideas through an iterative process. This **agile approach** results in significantly faster development time which is cost effective and reduces risk.

***Agile development cycle***

![No-code agile approach](/images/agile.png)

The main phases of an agile project are:

1. **Planning** - this involves determining the scope of the project, namely what is it you want to achieve, what end-users will be supported and how. The outcome will be a list of requirements that can be adjusted as the process is developed.
2. **Design** - this involves constructing one ore more draft processes. Previewing the draft is included in this phase and there may be several rounds of revisions. 
3. **Launch** - this phase includes piloting the process with a number of users, monitoring results, getting feedback and then releasing the process including all related documentation.

Mapping these phases to process creation in Kianda, results in three main steps: **Plan > Design > Publish**. Each step contains three substeps.



## Creating your Kianda processes in an agile way ##

***Three steps to create a process***

Using Kianda allows you to leverage the agile development process to maximum effect:

1. **Plan** - our documentation will guide you when it's time for you to capture your requirements.

   ![A](/images/greena.png) What **forms** and **fields** do you need in your process based on what you want to do?

   ![B](/images/greenb.png) What **rules** can be applied to create smart, automated processes?

   ![C](/images/greenc.png) Who needs **access** to the forms as a user and form owner? Review these questions as you modify the process.
    </br>  

 2. **Design** - you can create draft processes and restore to earlier versions, allowing you complete control over production.

    ![A](/images/a.png) Processes are made up of interactive **forms** which you can create at the click of a button.

    ![B](/images/b.png) Forms connect to your **datasources** so, as your organisation changes, your processes respond accordingly.

    ![C](/images/c.png) Use the in-built **previewer** to preview and test your design, then save new versions as you modify your process design.
    </br>

3. **Publish** - expand access to published processes as you become comfortable with the design.

   ![A](/images/bluea.png) Allow individual user, group or partner access in order to **deploy** your solution in a controlled way.

   ![B](/images/blueb.png) View key metrics in process **dashboards** to get insights into how to improve your process and organisation.

   ![C](/images/bluec.png) **Launch** and release your process, including documentation which can feed into future development projects.

   


### What's next  ![Idea icon](/images/18.png) ###

Now that you are familiar with the development cycle, you can start to develop your Kianda process following these simple steps:

![1](/images/one.png)  [**Plan your process**](/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/) 

![2](/images/two.png)  [**Design and build your process**](/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/)

![3](/images/three.png)  [**Publish your process**](/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/publish-your-process/)
