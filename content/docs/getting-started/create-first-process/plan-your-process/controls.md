**Controls** are predefined field widgets that allow you to add specific elements to your forms and processes, such as buttons, lists, text boxes and tables. There are 16 different types of controls (fields) to choose from - see [Controls list](#controls-list).

If you have developer skills, you can create your own custom field widget - see [Developer](/docs/getting-started/welcome//low-code/#how-to-get-started-with-developer) for more information.



## Getting started with Controls ##

If you go to **Side menu** >**Administration** > **Designer** and click on an existing process or create a new process and then select a form within that process (so that the Edit form buttton - Pen icon - is visible), you will see the pre-defined **Controls** options in the left-hand pane. If the Controls menu is collapsed, click on it to expand it.

***Control categories***

By default, there are three categories of fields:

1. **Input** - There are eight types of Input fields. They include the most common data fields such as textbox, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number fields.
2. **Layout** - There are four Layout fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields.
3. **Action** - There are four Action fields that allow you to insert user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components. By default, three buttons are automatically added to each new form created - Submit, Save and Close.

A fourth category, **Custom** fields, exists if Kianda **Developer** has been used to create custom field widgets - see [Developer](/docs/getting-started/welcome/low-code/#how-to-get-started-with-developer) for more details.

All fields will have edit options when you start creating the field, as well as [field properties](/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/design-and-build/add-controls-and-rules/properties/#field-properties) that you can edit. Each field can also have [rules](/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/plan-your-process/rules/) applied to it.
