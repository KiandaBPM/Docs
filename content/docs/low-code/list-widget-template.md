## Introduction

In the [dashboard pages](/docs/platform/pages/) how to create a dashboard page is described, so that you can display data from your processes and monitor how processes are performing, for example number of requests submitted, use of the [KiandaAI rule](/platform/rules/kianda-ai/text-analysis/) to extract a sentiment score from user input, number of 'completed' processes and so on.

The [List widget](docs/platform/pages/list/) is introduced within the dashboard pages section. Where the list widget displays the process instances or records of selected process(es) in the dashboard. An example of a **list widget** is shown in the image below, where the 'Training Requests' list displays the ID of a process instance, the status of that process instance and employee name of the person who submitted the initial request, amongst other data.

It is easy to configure this widget to have it filter and display data the way you want by following the steps at [Configure your widget](/docs/platform/pages/list/#configure-your-widget). However in addition to these steps you can use HTML to change the display. The next section [How to get started](#how-to-get-started) runs through an example of how to change the look and feel of a list widget.
