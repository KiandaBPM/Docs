## Introduction

As a workspace **Administrator** you can add a **Global JavaScript** file to add new functionality to your organisation's workspace that is **globally available**, for example a helper class or a helper method that is can be called from different parts of the platform. Your function could also bind to an onscreen element, for example if a user clicks on a particular element on screen you may want that a specific action happens using JavaScript.

The **Global JavaScript editor** exists within the **Subscription details** section of the Subscription function, within the **Administration** section of the site, see [Subscription](/docs/platform/administration/subscription/) for an introduction to the **Subscription** function.
