# Introduction 

The **Client connector** function allows Kianda users to create customised data source connectors thereby allowing Kianda to push to, use and pull information from external data sources.  

**Note**: Client Connectors are now available for use in **beta mode** .

A set of predefined data connectors are available under **Administration** and **Data sources**, however this new feature found under **Developer resources**, will allow an organisation to build their own connector to any external system beyond the predefined list.

Please note you must have the correct level of role to **create** and **use** the client connector, where typically **Developers** create the customised connector, while **Designers** use the customised connector in process creation and edit. **Administrators** can implement all activities. 

## Features

The new Client connector function has the following features:

- Customizable data source connector
- Editable UI and JavaScript code similar to custom [rules](/docs/low-code/rule-widget/), [dashboard widgets](/docs/low-code/dashboard-widget/) and [fields](/docs/low-code/dashboard-widget/)
- Ability to alter the query payload 
- Add new custom data source settings 
- Sensitive data encryption in each call
