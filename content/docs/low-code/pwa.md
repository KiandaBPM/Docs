## Introduction

Progressive web applications are the next great trend for the mobile web. 

As the Kianda platform is a progressive web application, you can access your businesses' Kianda workspace as if it were a mobile application. Instead of having to download an application through your device's native application store, the PWA can be formatted and installed on your device so that you can easily access the website via a URL shortcut. This means with Kianda you get a digital experience that is native-like while maintaining online web benefits.

There are several benefits of using a PWA app when comparing to a web app or even a native only app.

- **Reliable** - apps keep working with or without network access, allowing for offline availability of resources. Even when your users are going through a tunnel or in a lift, changes are automatically queued offline and then synchronised when connectivity is restored.

- **Fast** - the app loads quickly thanks to having it installed locally on your device. This provides you with an increased ease of access experience as you are not required to download the application via your device's native application store.

- **Engaging** - when installing on your home screen with your brand icons, users receive timely push notifications that help them stay engaged. If you would prefer to not receive notifications, you can disable them and relevant updates will be executed in the background silently.

- **Secure** - PWAs make use of HTTP requests to transfer data, which minimises potential security threats.

- **Responsive** - the Kianda platform is designed to be responsive on a myriad of mobile devices which reduces any future developmental costs.

## Offline or online

As we know in some cases, when there is no internet connection, websites are completely constrained to be shown appropriately. On the other hand, progressive web applications are regularly independent, enabling users to browse the app when not online, this increases engagement and availability greatly. With an offline mode, any information can be saved automatically during the last online access.

Emphasize benefits to potential clients who are frequently operating in remote areas with no access to the internet.

## Performance

Progressive web apps are faster because of the way the underlying technology caches and serves text, stylesheets, images and other content on the websites. As a result user experience, consistency and conversion rate increase.

Progressive web apps utilize service workers, which are JavaScript files that run independently from the main browser thread and efficiently control caching, this is how progressive web apps enhance better performance than traditional web apps.
