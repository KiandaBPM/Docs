## Introduction

No-Code development involves the creation of applications or business processes without the need to code. A no-code platform provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) so that **citizen developers** or non-IT business professionals can easily create and deploy digital solutions to meet business needs. 

Regardless of how the solution is created, the output must meet all the requirements of a modern web application - being accessible through all major browsers and platforms and responsive in design so that it can be used on a variety of devices.

Kianda form and dashboard **Designer** provides an intuitive interface where both technical and non-technical users can quickly start building digital processes and forms for use on any type of device.

## Why choose no-code development

No-code development with Kianda simplifies the whole process of creating forms and its functionality. You can develop a fully working solution to your business needs, in days and even hours. You do not need to know how to code or even know what coding is. Kianda's GUI consists of 16 predefined [fields](/docs/platform/controls/) and 60 [rules](/docs/platform/rules/) that you can choose from, you can simply click on a field to create it, change the layout of fields by drag and dropping them where suited. To apply a rule, select a field and click on the rule that you want to be applied. There is nothing easier than that, no need for working hours on end to develop a textbox field and its validation. 

With Kianda being a platform that focuses on automating business processes with the usage of forms. The no-code aspect is crucial as you can develop a fully automated process very quickly, compared to your typical ways of developing an applications, forms or websites. 

Kianda also allows you to connect to multiple data sources that your organisation may already be using, for example, SharePoint, DocuSign, Active Directory or any relational database such as SQL, MySQL or Oracle, see [Data connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/) for more. When a connection has been established with any data source that your organisation is using, you can use data from the source within your Kianda processes. This makes Kianda dynamic and to add dynamic features to your process, you can use the predefined rules that are available.
