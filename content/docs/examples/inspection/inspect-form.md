To create an Inspection Form for this process, we will take a look back at our [requirements](/docs/examples/inspection/#planning-form-requirements).







Here we will create an **Inspection Form** for our process. The form will be used by our engineer, he will fill it out and submit it. We will add a rule to **Generate a word document** and a rule to **Convert to PDF**. The PDF file will be then sent to the **Safety Manager** which we will get from the **Request Form**. First we need to create a new **Inspection Form**.

### Create new form

1. In the process creation page, click on **Add form**
