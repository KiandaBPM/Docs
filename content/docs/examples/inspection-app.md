title: "Simple Inspection process"
---

In this example we will step through how to create a simple Inspection process made up of two forms: 

- a **Request form** which is completed by a company employee, requesting an engineer to visit a specific location to perform an inspection
- an **Inspection form** which contains the inspection checklist that the engineer must complete

The result at the end of the process is an email to a designated Safety manager, who receives a PDF report of the inspection form.

The process will use **utility panels** to hold form fields and values, not visible to the end user, but these will be used with rules to automate the process.
