The **Recycle bin** function is available to administrators and is found in the left-hand side pane, under **Administration**. The recycle bin holds deleted process instances, dashboard pages and process designs. Deleted items are held for 30 days and are permanently deleted after this time.

### How to get started

To view items in the Recycle bin:

1. Click on **Administration** in the left-hand side pane and then click on **Recycle bin**. 

2. You can view any deleted items in the main recycle bin view. 

   ![Recycle bin main view](/images/recycle-bin-view.jpg)

   The first column in the view shows **Item type** and in this example there are two processes, four dashboard pages and five process instances.

3. To restore an item click on the **Restore item** button ![Restore recycle bin button](/images/restore-bin-item.jpg) beside the item name. 

4. When you click on the button you will get a pop-up confirmation asking you to confirm that you want to restore that item, click on **OK** if you wish to restore the item or **Cancel** to exit. If you click on **OK** the item is restored, for example a dashboard page appears again under **Dashboard** in the left-hand pane.
