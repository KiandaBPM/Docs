### How to get started

   In this view you can typically make changes to six areas:

   - **Look and Feel** allows you to change the look and feel for your workspace, for example adding company logos. 
   - **Design Login Page** allows you to design the login page for your workspace for example to change,  background and font colours and add taglines.
   - **Regional Settings** allows you to set your operational **time zone** and **regional settings**, such as English Ireland for language.
   - **Mobile Settings** allows you to customise how the Kianda workspace will appear as a mobile app.
   - **Subscription Details**
   - **Single Sign-On (SSO)** 

   These areas are covered in more detail in the sections below.

3. Click on a particular area to edit details or click on **Open Wizard** to use a wizard to edit **Look and Feel**, **Design Login Page**, **Regional Settings**, and **Mobile Settings**.

   
#### Look and Feel
