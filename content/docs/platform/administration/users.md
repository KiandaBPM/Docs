## Introduction

The **Users** function is available to users with the **Administrator** role and is found in the left-hand side menu under **Administration**. This function allows you to manage users and groups in your Kianda workspace.


## How to get started

To access the **Users** function:

1. Click on **Administration** in the left-hand side pane and then click on **Users**. 

2. You can view any existing users and groups that have been created in the main view pane. 

   ![Users main view](/images/user-main-view3.png)

   

   The two main areas are 1. **Users** and 2. **Groups**. These two areas are explained in more detail below. 

   

## Users

Existing users appear within this section, showing the **name** of the user, **email**, **role** and whether they are **active** or not in the system.  

![User management main user view](/images/user-mgmt-view2.png)

From this main view, you can:

- [**view and edit** existing user details](#view-and-edit-existing-user-details)
- [**create a new user**](#create-a-new-user)
- [create new **profile attributes**](#modify-profile-attributes)
- [bulk **import and export** users](#importing-and-exporting-users)
- [**add and remove users** to/from groups](#groups)

Click on each of the links above to read more about each function. In addition to the above administrative functions, you can also set passwords and delete users from this main view as follows:

- To **reset a password** for a user, click on the **Reset password/key** button ![Reset password/key button](/images/reset-password.jpg) beside a user name. This will open the **reset password** dialog box where you can type in a new password for the user.

![Reset password dialog box](/images/reset-password-box.jpg)

â€‹		When you are finished adding the new password, click on **OK**, or click on **Close** to exit the dialog box. 

- To **delete an existing user**, click on the **Bin/Trash** button beside a user name. 

  ![Delete an existing user](/images/delete-user-popup.jpg)

- Then click on **OK**.



### Licenses

Before managing the user accounts on your platform, you will need to understand the concept of **Licenses**.  Depending on your subscription type, you will be allocated a certain number of licenses, which allow your users to be active on your platform. 

A single license is used by each individual active user within your platform, for example if your platform has 250 total licenses and you have 19 activated accounts, you will have 231 remaining licenses. If a user license is **issued**, the total number of licenses will **decrease**, and if a user license is **revoked**, the total number of licenses will **increase**. If there are no more remaining licenses, new users will be deactivated. You can get more licenses by deactivating users or purchasing additional licenses.

### View and edit existing user details

1. Click on the **name** of a user and the user details appear.

2. In the details box you can edit a user's:

   - **First name** - user's first name
   - **Last name** - user's last name
   - **Display name** - how their name will display in the system. The display name is autofilled based off of the user's entered first and last names, which can be changed if necessary.
   - **License activation status** - Checking this box will create the user as active. This will consume a license from your subscription. If you are out of licenses you will be prompted to purchase an additional license.

     - **User** - lowest level of access where users with this role can access dashboards and forms, Help and Account details

   - **Profile picture URL** - click on **Browse** to browse for a profile picture on a laptop or network drive to add a profile photo for the user.

Seen below is an example CSV output in excel:

![exported csv image](/images/csv-file-export.png)



## Groups ##

When you create predefined **groups,** you can use these group names in a myriad of ways, for example to create a set of finance managers who can then be listed as [form owners](/docs/platform/application-designer/forms/form-owners/) to edit forms in process instances for procurement, or a set of contractors in an [SSO bypass group](/docs/security/sso/) who can go the workspace login page to login to Kianda.

![Groups in User Management](/images/groups.jpg)

Existing groups appear within the **Groups** section of the **User management page**, showing the **name** of the group and the **number of members**.

From this main view you can:

- [view and edit group members](#viewing-and-editing-group-members)
- [view and edit group details](#viewing-and-editing-group-details)
- [delete groups](#deleting-groups)
- [create a new group](#creating-new-groups)




### Viewing and editing group members

3. You can also change **users** from the current group **to another group** by clicking on the dropdown list of group names, by choosing a group, checking the checkbox beside the username.

   ![Add user to group](/images/add-user-to-group2.png)

4. Click on **Add user(s) to group**.

### Viewing and editing group details

1. Click on the **group name** in the main view to see details for a group.
2. The **Edit group 'Name'** dialog box appears. 

![Edit group dialog box](/images/edit-group.jpg)

3. In this dialog box you can edit:

   - **Group name** - the name of the group

   - **Primary role** - the primary role of the group

   - **Group member sync** - options are **No** or **Yes**. By choosing **Yes** this allows synchronisation of the Kianda group with Active Directory or other databases connected to Kianda as data sources. As a result of choosing Yes, other parameters appear:

     - **Override group members** - choose from **No** or **Yes**. By choosing **Yes**, a full synchronisation is enabled between the Kianda group and the data source of users. Any users that are not listed in the data source, will be removed from this group in Kianda.

       ![Group member synch](/images/group-sync.jpg)

     - **Datasource** - choose a data source from the dropdown list. This data source must be already created, see [Data connectors](/docs/platform/connectors/) for more details.

     - **Group name** - choose a name for the group if desired.

     - **Auto disable previously imported users that are missing on re-import** - choose from **No** or **Yes**. By choosing **Yes**, any previously imported users that no longer exist in the data source, will be disabled in Kianda when re-synchronisation is executed. Their account will still exist in the system, but they will no longer be able to login to Kianda. 

     - **Auto remove previously imported users that are missing on re-import** - choose from **No** or **Yes**. By choosing **Yes**, any previously imported users that no longer exist in the data source, will be removed from Kianda when re-synchronisation is executed. They will no longer be able to login to Kianda as their account will be removed from the system. 
     
	    Note: When a group is synchronised, a **scheduled task** is created to import users from the data source group every one hour by default. This can be changed by going to **Administration** > **Scheduled tasks**. Go to [Scheduled tasks](/docs/platform/administration/scheduledtasks/) to find out more about different schedules.
     
   - **Group administrators** - only **Users** or **Groups** listed here can manage the group; if you leave the field blank then Kianda administrators can manage the group.
