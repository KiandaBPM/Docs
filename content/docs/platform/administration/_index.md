The **Administration** menu contains all the functions you need to maintain your Kianda workspace.

The menu is found in the left-hand side pane when you log in to Kianda. This menu will only appear if you have a certain role, for example Administrators will see all items shown in the image below.

Other roles like **Developer**, or **Design business process role** will have access to the Administration menu, but will only see role-related items within the menu. For example a Developer will only see **Developer** within Administration, while a person with a Design business process role will only see **Designer** within Administration. User roles are set by Administrator who will have access to the **Users** function within administration. If you have full administration access then you will see nine functions by default within administration. These are:

- **Designer** - users with the Designer business process role and administrators can access this function to design business processes

- **App Store** - administrators can access predefined process templates within the App Store, and use these templates to create business process.

- **Subscription** - administrators can update an organisation's subscription details, including Single Sign On, workspace look and feel and regional settings.

- **Data sources** - users with the Manage datasources role and administrators can access this function to connect a workspace to external data sources such as SAP, SharePoint and Oracle databases.

- **Scheduled tasks** - administrators can access this function to schedule tasks which can be full processes or parts of a process, for example to execute a rule, and schedule these tasks for a desired period or on demand.

- **Recycle bin** - administrators can access deleted processes, tasks and process instances in the recycle bin.

- **Users** - administrators can manage user accounts using this function for example setting roles, profile properties, creating and deleting groups.

- **Invite partner** - users with the Manage partners role and administrators can access this function to invite business partners to view processes. 

- **Developer** - developers and administrators can access this function to create customised field, rule and dashboard widgets.
