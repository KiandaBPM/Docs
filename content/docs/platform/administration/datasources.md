**Data sources** are available to administrators and those users with the role manage datasources from the left-hand side pane, under Administration. The data sources function allows you to connect your processes to external data sources like SharePoint, Salesforce or SAP. 

Connecting your data sources in this way allows real-time scalability, so as your organisation and data grows, the processes created in Kianda will continue to operate with these data sources, providing sustainable, flexible growth.

Kianda comes with 19 predefined **data connectors** allowing you to connect to these data sources. These are listed below:



If you are a developer and want to connect to a datasource that is not included in the predefined set, you can use SOAP or REST to create your own API for data transfer.
