   These are two main areas: **Support tickets** and **Application logs** these are explained in more detail below. 
   
   
#### Support tickets
Existing support tickets appear within this section, showing the **title** of the ticket, **date** it was issued and **status**. 

##### For existing tickets:

1. Click on the **name** of a ticket to view ticket details, such as who raised the ticket and a description of the title.
2. Click on **update status** to change the title of the field or update the status. The status can either be **Open**, **Resolved** (resolved from the Kianda support side) or **Closed** (customer is satisfied with the resolution and has closed the ticket). Click on **Close** to exit without saving or **OK** to submit changes.
3. Click on **reply** to add a comment to the ticket. The comment can be styled to change the font colour, paragraph layout, add tables, links or images.
