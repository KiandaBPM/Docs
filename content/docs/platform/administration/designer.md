Kianda **Designer** is available to administrators and those users with the role **Designer**. Designer is found in the left-hand side pane, under **Administration**. The Designer function allows you to create processes and forms using the intuitive easy-to-use no-code interface. Within Designer you can create forms, add controls and rules to create processes to work the way you want.

### How to get started

To start creating a process so that Kianda Designer will open:

1. Click on **Administration** in the left-hand side pane and then click on **Designer**.

2. You can view any created processes in the main process view.

3. To view an existing process, click on a process name, or click on a folder or group to see processes within that group, for example a group like **Training** in the image above. 

4. To create a new process, click on the **Add new** button.

5. To import a process created for example in another workspace, click on **Import**. Also note that from the main process view you can also export processes listed here for use in another workspace, by clicking on **Export**.

6. To create a process using a predefined template, click on the **App Store**.

7. To create a new process, click on the **Add new** button. 

8. The Add new process dialog box appears.

   In this dialog box fill out the following fields:

   - **Title** - give the new process a title
   - **ID** - the Unique ID field is autofilled from the title field
   - **Description** - a short description that describes the new process
   - **Group** - choose an existing group/folder to add the new process to, or type in a new group name to create a new group of processes
   - **Administrators** - choose from **Users**, **Groups** or a mix of both users and groups for people who will be administrators of this process. The process administrator(s) is the only person/people who can edit **draft** process designs. Once the process design is published, workspace administrators will be able to access the process design.

9. Once a process is opened, you are brought straight into Kianda **Designer**.

### Designer view

Kianda **Designer** is made up of three panes:

1. In the left-hand pane, you will find the **Controls** and **Rules** as well as buttons to **Save**, **Preview** and **Publish** processes, as well as exiting Kianda Designer to return to the main process view. 
2. In the centre pane, also called the **canvas**, you can view form details and manipulate form fields.
3. In the right-hand pane, you can view and edit process and field **properties** as well as viewing rules assigned to fields, forms and processes.
