Layout fields are one category of [controls](fields/Readme.md) and include the fields used to enhance form layout for example using responsive panels, dialog box and rich text fields. 



## Getting started with Layout fields ##

If you go to **Administration** > **Designer** and click on a process or create a new process, then click on **Controls** the layout fields are found in the left-hand pane when you click on **Layout**.

There are 4 types of layout fields as follows:

- **Panel** - responsive panels hold elements of your form like text boxes and lists, see [Panel](panel.md) for more information.

- Dialog

- **Richtext** - richtext is used to create rich content in forms, for example an attractive banner, and provides optimum formatting options, see [Richtext](richtext.md) for more information.

- **Field group** - is a convenient way to mirror a group of fields that are already created in a form, and reference those fields in your new form, making process design sleeker, see [Field group](field_group.md) for more details.
