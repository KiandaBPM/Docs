Layout fields are one category of [controls](/docs/platform/controls/) (fields). They are fields that can be used to enhance the layout of your form - for example, responsive panels, dialog boxes and rich text fields.



## Getting started with Layout fields ##

1. To insert a **Layout field** into a form, first open an existing process or create a new process by going to **Administration**>**Designer** in the left side menu. See [Create First Process](/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/) to learn how to create your first process.

2. Then select the form within that process that you want to add the Layout field to (so that the **Edit Form** button ![Edit form button](/images/penicon.png) is visible).

3. Next, click on **Controls** in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu and select **Layout** to view the Layout fields. Then click on the Layout field you want to insert.

	There are 4 types of layout fields:

- **Panel** - The Panel field provides responsive panels to hold elements of your form like text boxes and lists and enables flexible layout options for better design. To learn more, go to [Panel](/docs/platform/controls/layout/panel/).

- **Dialog** - The Dialog field is used to create modal dialogs to alert or prompt form users. For example, a warning message could display to remind the user to complete part of a form before they proceed to the next section. To learn more, go to [Dialog](/docs/platform/controls/layout/dialog/).

- **Richtext** - The Richtext field is used to create rich content in forms, such as an attractive banner or static html, and provides optimum formatting options. To learn more, go to [Richtext](/docs/platform/controls/layout/richtext/).

- **Field group** - The Field Group control can be used to mirror a group of fields from another form or location and reference those fields in your new form, making process design sleeker and more efficient. To learn more, go to [Field group](/docs/platform/controls/layout/field-group/).



### How to add, edit, move and delete Layout fields ###

#### How to add Layout fields ####

To insert a **Layout field** into your form, click on the field type you want to add from the **Layout** menu. 

For example, to add a new panel to your form, click on **Panel** - a pop-up message will appear saying '**Field added**' and a panel field with the default name **Panel 1** will be added to your form (by default, the title of the new panel will not be shown but you can make it visible by selecting the '**Show title**' checkbox in the **Field properties** panel to the right).

#### How to edit Layout fields ####

To edit whatever type of **Layout field** you have added to your form, select the field (by either clicking on the field name or on the **Drag handle** button ![Drag handle button](/images/draghandlewhite-frame.png)) and then click on the **Edit Field** button (Pen icon) ![Pen button](/images/penicon.png). In our example, we have selected the **Panel field** by clicking the Drag handle button and can then click on the Edit field button to edit it.

This will open up the **Edit Field** dialog box where you can make various changes (such as changing the Title of the field) and where a variety of options will be available to you, depending on the type of Layout field you have selected.

#### How to move Layout fields ####

To move a Layout field, simply select the field's **Drag handle** button ![Drag handle button](/images/draghandlewhite-frame.png) and drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it within your form.

#### How to delete Layout fields ####

To delete an input field from your form, select the field (by either clicking on the field's name or its **Drag handle** button ![Drag handle button](/images/draghandlewhite-frame.png)), click on the **Bin/Trash** button ![Bin icon](/images/binicon.png) and then click on **OK** to confirm.



### How to edit Layout field properties ###

To view or edit the field properties associated with a **Layout field**, select the field (by clicking on the field title or drag handle button ![Drag handle button](/images/draghandlewhite-frame.png)) - the **Field properties** menu will appear in the right-hand pane.

In the example shown here, a **Panel** titled '**Existing Qualifications** has been selected and the **Field properties** associated with the Panel are shown in the panel to the right. They include: the field type (Panel), title, that the title will be shown in the form (the 'Show title' checkbox has been selected), that the field will be visible in the form (the 'Visible' checkbox has been selected) and how wide the field layout will be on a PC and mobile phone (the blue bars in 'Layout').

To learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to [Field Properties](/docs/platform/controls/properties#field-properties).



### Saving changes and version history ###

Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the **Save** button ![Save](/images/saveprocess.png). You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the **Design Version History** ![Version button](/images/version8.png) button in the top right corner.
