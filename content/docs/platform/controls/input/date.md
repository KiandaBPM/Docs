**Date controls** or **Date fields** can be inserted in a form when you want a user to be able to input a date and time by using a date and time picker. For example, in a Training Request form, you may want the user to select the date and time of the training course they want to attend.

## How to get started

1. To add a **Date field** to a form, first open the relevant process and then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the **Edit Form** button ![Edit form button](/images/penicon.png) is visible). 


2. Insert the **Date field** by clicking on **Controls** in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu, then select **Input** to view the range of Input controls and click on **Date**. A date field will be added to your form with the default title of '**Date 1**' and a green pop-up message will say 'Field added'.
