**Date controls** or **Date fields** can be inserted in a form when you want a user to be able to input a date and time by using a date and time picker. For example, in a Training Request form, you may want the user to select the date and time of the training course they want to attend.

## How to get started

1. To add a **Date field** to a form, first open the relevant process. Then select the form within that process that you want to add the field to (so that the **Edit Form** button ![Edit form button](/images/penicon.png) is visible). 


2. Insert the **Date field** by clicking on **Controls** in the left-hand pane to expand the Controls menu, then select **Input** to view the range of Input controls and click on **Date**. A date field will be added to your form with the default title of '**Date 1**' and a pop-up message will say 'Field added'.

3. The Date field has a small calendar icon on the right hand side - when the user clicks on this icon a calendar is displayed, allowing them to select a date.

### How to edit, move and delete Date fields

To edit a **Date field**, select the field (by either clicking on the field title or on the field's **Drag handle** button ![Drag handle button](/images/draghandlewhite_frame.png)) and then click on the **Edit field** button (Pen icon) ![Edit field button](/images/penicon.png).

The **Edit field** dialog box will open, enabling you to choose from a range of options.

The options within the **Edit date field dialog box** include:

- **Title** - you can change the title of the date field
- **Help text** - you can insert help text a user can view when completing the date field
- **Display format** - you can choose whether the date field shows the date only or the date and time
- **Adjust to user timezone** - you can select this if you want the date field to adjust to the time zone of the form user
- **Default date** - you can choose to set a default date for the date field (now, today, or a time relative to now)
- **Enable native picker on mobile** - you can choose to allow users who are completing the date field on a mobile phone to use the default pop-up date picker associated with their mobile phone

To move a **Date field**, simply select the field's **Drag handle** button ![Drag handle button](/images/draghandlewhite_frame.png) and drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it to within your form.

To delete a **Date field** from your form, simply select the field (by either clicking on the field's name or its **Drag handle** button ![Drag handle button](/images/draghandlewhite_frame.png)), click on the **Bin/Trash** button ![Bin icon](/images/binicon.png) and then click on **OK** to confirm.

### How to edit Date field properties ###
To view or edit the field properties associated with a **Date field**, select the field (by clicking on the field title or field drag handle button ![Drag handle button](/images/draghandlewhite_frame.png)) - the **Field properties** menu will appear in the right-hand pane.

In the example shown here, a **Date field** titled **Date** has been selected in a form called 'Expense Report' and the Field properties associated with this field include its Title, that its title will be shown in the form (the 'Show title' checkbox is ticked), that this will not be a field users are required to complete (the 'Required' checkbox is not selected), that this field will be enabled for users to complete (the 'Enabled' checkbox is ticked), and that this field will be visible to form users (the 'Visible' checkbox is ticked).

To learn more about the different options within the Field properties menu, go to [Field Properties](/docs/platform/controls/properties/#field-properties/).

### Saving changes and version history ###
Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the **Save** button ![Save](/images/saveprocess.png). You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the **Design Version History** ![Version button](/images/version8.png) button in the top right corner.
