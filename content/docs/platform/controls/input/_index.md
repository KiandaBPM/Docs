**Input fields** are one category of [controls](../) and include the most common data fields used to obtain user input - for example text boxes, lists and tables.



## Getting started with Input controls ##

To start adding Input controls (fields) to your Kianda forms:

1. First, either open an existing process or create a new process by going to **Administration** > **Designer** in the left side menu. See [Create First Process](/docs/getting-started/create-first-process/) to learn how to create your first process.

2. Once you have opened your process, select the form you want to work on (so that the **Edit Form** button ![Pen icon](/images/penicon.png) is shown) and then click on **Controls** in the left-hand pane so the Controls menu expands to show the four categories of Controls (fields): Input, Layout, Actions and Custom.

The eight types of input fields are:

- **Text box** - A text box field is a section in your form where users can enter text, for example, an Address field. See [Text box control](/docs/platform/controls/input/textbox/) for more information. 
- **List** - A list field lists information, for example from a SharePoint data source. This is particular useful for dropdown menus, when you want a user to fill out a form and choose an item from a list. See [List control](/docs/platform/controls/input/list/) for more information.
- **Number** - A number field provides an input box that only allows numeric input, such as currencies or percentages.
- **Date** - A date field provides a date and time picker that allows users to input both date and time.
- **File** - A file field allows users to upload multiple files. Uploaded files are stored within the configured data structures or folders.
- **Table** - A table field creates a table for input in a form. This table can be filled by the user, or autofilled as part of a rule.
- **User picker** - A user picker field allows users to choose from a list of users. This can be a preconfigured group (like HR Managers) or a list of users - see [User picker control](/docs/platform/controls/input/user-picker/) for more information.
- **Toggle** - A toggle field can be used as a toggle or checkbox that allows users to turn on/off components of the form.



### How to add, edit, move and delete Input fields ###

To insert an **Input field** into your form, click on the field type you want to add from the **Input** menu. For example, to add a new text box field, click on **Text box** - a pop-up message will appear saying 'Field added' and a new text box with the default name **Text box 1** will be added to your form.

To edit whatever type of input field you have added to your form:

1. Select the field (by either clicking on the field name or on the **Drag handle** button ![Drag handle button](/images/draghandlewhite-frame.png))
2. Then click on the **Edit Field** button (Pen icon) ![Pen button](/images/penicon.png). 
3. The **Edit Field** dialog box will automatically open, providing you with a variety of options for editing the field - such as changing the Title of the field - depending on the type of Input field you are working with.

2. Drag and drop the field wherever you want to move it within your form. This example shows how you could move a Text box field in a form:

2. Click on the **Bin/Trash** button ![Bin icon](/images/binicon.png) 
3. Click on **OK** to confirm.

You can also view and edit an input field's **Field Properties** by selecting the field - for more details, see [Field Properties](/docs/platform/controls/properties/#field-properties/).

### Saving changes and version history ###
Make sure to save any changes you make by clicking on the **Save** button ![Save](/images/saveprocess.png). You will always have the option to revert back to previous versions of your form by clicking the **Design Version History** ![Version button](/images/version8.png) button in the top right corner.
