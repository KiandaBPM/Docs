## Introduction

Access to the B2B Portal is controlled through standard user and group creation, dashboard security and through how the Shared Processes and Dashboards are defined.

### When to use

B2B Portals are a means of connecting your clients to your Kianda subscription through their own subscription. This provides a means of allowing your clients to interface with processes you have already created, be it through updating existing processes, deleting processes or creating processes. Access to the B2B Portal can be controlled by your own administrator and each B2B Portal can have multiple users for your clients.

**How to get started.**

To create **Users & Groups** navigate to the **Administration** section of the Portal and enter the **Users & Groups** section. Within this page you will be able to view all existing **Users** in the **Portal** on the left-hand side, their email, role and if they are active or not. All existing **Groups** can be seen in the right-hand side of the screen.
