## Introduction

Within the **B2B Portal** your clientâ€™s administrator will be able to create as many **Partner Profiles** (**users**) as they wish. By creating these **users**, they will have the ability to access the **B2B Portal** and interact with the **Dashboards** and **Processes** shared with them. For more information on how  **B2B Portal** users access shared data go to [Data access](/docs/platform/b2b-portals/data-access/), as well as [Shared dashboards](/docs/platform/b2b-portals/shared-dashboard/) for information on dashboards, and [Shared process](/docs/platform/b2b-portals/shared-process/) for information on processes. 

## When to use

Your client will need to add **Partner Profiles** in order for their employees to have access to the **B2B Portal**. At this point your subscription will need to have been created and Administrators created. If this has not happened yet, please get in touch with your Account Manager or [Kianda Support](mailto:support@kianda.com) to begin the process.

## How to get started

In order to begin a user with an **Administrator** role or **Manage partner** role will need to log into your subscription. Using one of these roles:

1. Navigate to **Invite Partner** within the **Administration** section. 

2. Within this page click on the **Invite Partner** Button. 

3. In the **Invite partner** dialog box populate the fields with the details of the person you want to share your **Processes** and **Dashboards** with.

   The fields in this box are:

   - **Partner organisation** - provide the name of the partner organisation

   - **Contact first name** - provide the first name of a contact in the partner organisation

   - **Contact last name** - provide the surname of a contact in the partner organisation

   - **Contact email** - provide the email of a contact

   - **Shared process selection** - in the dropdown list choose a shared process created using the steps listed in [To share a process](#to-share-a-process).

   - Click on **More fields** to see more fields these include: **Partner country**, **Partner city**, and **Partner logo** which you can add by clicking on **Browse** and browsing your PC or network.

4. Within your subscription you will be able to see if they have accepted their **invitation** based on the **status**. **Pending** means they have not accepted the **invite**, **active** means they have accepted the **invite**.

5. When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on **OK**, or else click on **Close** to exit the dialog box at any stage. Clicking on **OK** will save the partner and will result in an invitation being sent to their email address, similar to the one below.
