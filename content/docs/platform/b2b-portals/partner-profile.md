## Introduction

Within the **B2B Portal** your client’s administrator will be able to create as many **Partner Profiles** (**users**) as they wish. By creating these **users**, they will have the ability to access the **B2B Portal** and interact with the **Dashboards** and **Processes** shared with them. For more information on how  **B2B Portal** users access shared data go to [Data access](/docs/platform/b2b-portals/data-access/), as well as [Shared dashboards](/docs/platform/b2b-portals/shared-dashboard/) for information on dashboards, and [Shared process](/docs/platform/b2b-portals/shared-process/) for information on processes. 

## When to use

Your client will need to add **Partner Profiles** in order for their employees to have access to the **B2B Portal**. At this point your subscription will need to have been created and Administrators created. If this has not happened yet, please get in touch with your Account Manager or [Kianda Support](mailto:support@kianda.com) to begin the process.

## How to get started

In order to begin a user with an **Administrator** role or **Manage partner** role will need to log into your subscription. Using one of these roles:

1. Navigate to **Invite Partner** within the **Administration** section. 

2. Within this page click on the **Invite Partner** Button. 

3. In the **Invite partner** dialog box populate the fields with the details of the person you want to share your **Processes** and **Dashboards** with.

   The fields in this box are:

   - **Partner organisation** - provide the name of the partner organisation

   - **Contact first name** - provide the first name of a contact in the partner organisation

   - **Contact last name** - provide the surname of a contact in the partner organisation

   - **Contact email** - provide the email of a contact

   - **Shared process selection** - in the dropdown list choose a shared process created using the steps listed in [To share a process](#to-share-a-process).

   - Click on **More fields** to see more fields these include: **Partner country**, **Partner city**, and **Partner logo** which you can add by clicking on **Browse** and browsing your PC or network.

4. When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on **OK**, or else click on **Close** to exit the dialog box at any stage. Clicking on **OK** will save the partner and will result in an invitation being sent to their email address, similar to the one below.

5. As a partner click on the **Accept** button. Then you are linked to a greeting page asking you to sign up to Kianda if you don't have a login. Click on the **Sign up** button if you don’t have a subscription.

### Accepting a partner invite without a subscription

1. If you do have a subscription please continue to the section detailing what to do after when **login** is clicked [Accepting a partner invite with a subscription](#accepting-a-partner-invite-with-a-subscription), otherwise create a subscription, by entering your **Firstname**, **Lastname**, your **email**, a **password** and a **phone number**. Click **Next** when you are ready to continue.

2. In the next page configure the name of the subscription for the **B2B Portal.** Enter your **Company name**, an **Identity** that will form the beginning of your URL, the **Company Size**, **Industry**, **Address**, **Country** and **City**. Click **Start Trial** when ready to proceed. This will create and automatically log you into your subscription.

### Accepting a partner invite with a subscription

If you **already have a subscription** you can choose to **Login** instead of Signing up. By logging in you can log into your subscription and you will be given the option to accept the invite. Please note that you will need to be an **administrator** in your portal in order to accept the invite.

1. Click on the **Accept Invite** button. 

    ![Accept invite example](/images/invite-partner-greenitr.jpg)

2. You will be redirected to the Home page of the Subscription. You will now see the contents of the **Shared Process**.



### What's next  ![Idea icon](/images/18.png) ###

Within your subscription you will be able to see if an invited partner has accepted their **invitation** based on the **status**. **Pending** means they have not accepted the **invite**, **active** means they have accepted the **invite**.

Once an invite is accepted, your client’s/invited partner's employees can now access the B2B Portal and interact with the Dashboards and Processes that have been shared with them. For more information on how  **B2B Portal** users access shared data go to [Data access](/docs/platform/b2b-portals/data-access/), as well as [Shared dashboards](/docs/platform/b2b-portals/shared-dashboard/) for information on dashboards, and [Shared process](/docs/platform/b2b-portals/shared-process/) for information on processes.
