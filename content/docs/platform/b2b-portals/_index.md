B2B Portals are a means of connecting your clients to your Kianda subscription through their own subscription. This provides a means of allowing your clients to interface with processes you have already created. This could involve updating existing processes, deleting processes or creating processes. Access to the B2B Portal can be controlled by your own administrator and each B2B Portal can have multiple users for your clients.

Your client's subscription will need to be configured by Kianda so please reach out to your Account Manager or [Kianda Support](mailto:support@kianda.com) to arrange the set up.  

B2B Portals can be configured by users with the role **Administrator** or **Manage partners**. These users can access the function, found under **Administration** > **Invite Partner**.
