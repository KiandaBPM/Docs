## Introduction

A **Shared Dashboard** is a dashboard which you create within your own subscription with the intention to share with your B2B Portal. This **Dashboard**, as with all dashboards, can be used to review data, access **Shared Processes** by creating new instances, updating or deleting instances.

## When to use

It is necessary to share your **dashboard** with your **B2B** **Portal** when sharing **processes** and **dashboard** **widgets** with your Client. Before you can share a **dashboard** you must first create one. This **dashboard** can be one that you have already created, however, we recommend creating a unique dashboard that will be used specifically for sharing with B2B Portals. Go to [Dashboards](/docs/platform/pages/) to learn more about how to create dashboards.

## How to get started

Log into your subscription and navigate to the **Invite Partner** section located within **Administration.** Your role needs to be **Administrator** or **Manage partner** to view **Invite Partner**. Using one of these roles:

1. Navigate to **Invite Partner** within the **Administration** section.

3. The **Create a Shared Process** dialog box opens. 

   ![Edit Shared Process dialog box](/images/edit-shared-process.jpg)

   Populate the fields as desired:

   - **Title** - provide a title for the shared process

   - **Instructions for partner** - provide instructions for the selected partner

   - Click on the **plus symbol** ![Add shared process](/images/add-process.jpg) to add a selected process design to share. Then click on the dropdown list to search for a process to share.	

   - Click on the **tick symbol** ![Edit selected shared  process](/images/edit-selected-process.jpg) to add the selected shared process. To change the selected shared process properties by clicking on the **Cog/Settings** button ![Edit selected shared process properties](/images/cog-shared-process.jpg) or delete the selected shared process by clicking on the **Bin/trash** button ![Bin button for shared processes](/images/bin-shared-process.jpg).

     - If you click on the **Cog/Settings **button ![Edit selected shared process properties](/images/cog-shared-process.jpg) a **Process properties** dialog box appears, as shown above, for example Training Request properties. You can check radio buttons for:

       - **Allow partner to create a new process instance** - choose from **Yes** or **No**. If you choose **Yes**, then you are allowing invited partner(s) to create new process instances from the chosen shared process design. 
       - A field **Partner user group allowed to create new instances** appears, where you can define the group(s) in the partner organisation, that can create these new process instances. This is the first level of security for processes and dashboards. If you leave the field blank, then anyone in the partner organisation can create process instances.
       - **Allow partner delete a process instance** - choose from **Yes** or **No**. If you choose **Yes**, then you are allowing invited partner(s) to delete new process instances from the chosen shared process design.
       - Partner process form visibility mode - choose from **Assigned** or **All forms**. If you choose **Assigned**, then the invited partner(s) can view only assigned form versus all forms, if **All forms** is chosen.
       
        - When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on **OK**, or else click on **Close** to exit the dialog box at any stage. 
       
       - If you click on the **Bin/trash** button ![Bin button for shared processes](/images/bin-shared-process.jpg) then a pop-up appears to **Confirm removal**, choose from **OK** or **Cancel**. 
       
       ![Confirm removal of selected shared process](/images/confirm-removal.jpg)
       
       -  Click on the **Tick symbol** ![Edit selected shared  process](/images/edit-selected-process.jpg) to add further selected processes to share.
       -  Click on the **Add partner group** button to add one or more partner groups. Click on the **Bin/trash** button ![Bin button for shared processes](/images/bin-shared-process.jpg) to delete partner groups.

4. There are a set of dashboard parameters under the field **Add partner group**. These are:

   -  Under **Dashboard template** click on the dropdown list to select an existing dashboards to share with the selected processes. If you choose to share a dashboard then you can select parameters:
      -  **Dashboard name in partner** - choose from **Use your company name 'Name of your organisation'** or **Same as selected dashboard**
      -  **Make welcome page** - choose from **Yes** or **No**. If you choose **Yes** then the selected dashboard becomes the welcome page for the partner if no other welcome page is configured.
      -  **Dashboard security** - choose from created partner groups within this field to ensure that **only users** in these partner groups can access the dashboard. This is the method to set security on the dashboard specifically.

5. When you are finished editing the dialog box, click on **OK**, or else click on **Close** to exit the dialog box at any stage. 

6. Once you have completed configuring or modifying the **Shared Process** you will need to send the shared process to your partner. To do this press the **Send Update** button which appears in the main view of the **Shared processes** section.

### What's next  ![Idea icon](/images/18.png) ###

The dashboard you created is now available within the B2B Portal. When your partnerâ€™s users log into the B2B Portal they will be able to see the newly shared dashboard. From here they will be able to see the widgets within the dashboard and interact with the Processes. Go to the [Data Access](/docs/platform/b2b-portals/data-access/) and [Shared Process](/docs/platform/b2b-portals/shared-process/) pages to read more about related areas.
