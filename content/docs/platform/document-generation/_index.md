**Document generation** refers to the use of Kianda Add-ins for Word, and also Excel, that you can use to **generate reports** within Kianda processes and **populate** the reports with **data captured** within each process instance. This could be useful, for example, for inspection reports where a report template can be used to show the information the engineer input to a **Kianda form** during his inspection. Each time an inspection is performed, a report is generated based on a Word template and the report shows the relevant information that was captured during that particular inspection.

In the example above, a report will generate data pulled from a Kianda process instance (record) that contains the date, company and location data within an ‘Inspection Form’ and a ‘Request Form’. To create this kind of template, you can use a **Kianda Add-in** in Word to link your document to your Kianda process.

#### Using the Kianda Add-in

The example below steps through how to use the Kianda Add-in for Word, however the same steps apply to get started with the Kianda Add-in for Excel.

1. Create a template outline in Microsoft Word.
2. Click on the **Insert** tab > **Get Add-ins** and search for **Kianda**.
3. Click on **Add**, then **Continue** and click on the **Home** tab. The **Show Kianda Taskpane** should be added to your ribbon. Click on this button.
4. Log in using your username and password, and click on the process link button ![Process link button](https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/process-link-button.gif) to get a dropdown list of Kianda processes that you have access to based on your role, for example Administrator or Designer.
5. Select a relevant process and a relevant form – for example Inspection Form as used in the image above.
6. Position your cursor in the Word document at the point where you would like to add in form fields.
7. Select the Kianda form field you would like to add to the Word template.
8. Repeat for as many form fields as needed and format the document as necessary.
9. Save the template. You can then add in the template as a File field within the process in Kianda.

There is also a Kianda Add-in for Excel that is added in the same way as the Kianda Add-in for Word. Usage is very similar allowing you to connect an Excel spreadsheet to Kianda processes to create a template that can be used within processes.
