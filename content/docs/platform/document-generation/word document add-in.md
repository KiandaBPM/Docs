You can **generate reports** within Kianda processes and **populate** the reports with **data captured** within each process instance. This could be useful, for example, for inspection reports where a report template can be used to show the information the engineer input to a **Kianda form** during his inspection. Each time an inspection is performed, a report is generated based on a Word template and the report shows the relevant information that was captured during that particular inspection.

There is also a Kianda Add-in for Excel that is added in the same way as the Kianda Add-in for Word. Usage is very similar allowing you to connect an Excel spreadsheet to Kianda processes to create a template that can be used within processes. To learn more about adding Kianda to excel go to [Excel workbook add-in](/docs/platform/document-generation/excel-workbook-add-in/).
