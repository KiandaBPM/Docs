Responsive layout refers to the fact that all forms will display equally well on laptop screens, tablets and mobile phone screens. As a form designer you can set the appearance of form fields using the layout function.  



### How to get started

Within Kianda Designer, click on a process, then a form of choice so that the **Edit** (Pen) icon is visible.

1. Click on a **field** of choice within the form so the **Edit** (Pen) icon ![Edit pen icon](/images/penicon.png) is visible for the field.
2. Click on the **Edit** (Pen) icon button for the field.
3. Click on **Layout** under Field properties in the right-hand pane.

5. Click on the **Collapse** button to minimise the Layout property.
