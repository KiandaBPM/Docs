Responsive layout refers to the fact that all forms will display equally well on laptop screens, tablets and mobile phone screens. As a form designer you can set the appearance of form fields using the layout function.  



### How to get started

Within Kianda Designer, click on a process, then a form of choice so that the **Edit** (Pen) icon is visible.

1. Click on a **field** of choice within the form so the **Edit** (Pen) icon ![Edit pen icon](/images/penicon.png) is visible for the field.
2. Click on the **Edit** (Pen) icon button for the field.
3. Click on **Layout** under Field properties in the right-hand pane.

4. Click on the **Expand**![Layout expand](/images/layout-arrow.jpg) button within Layout to see desktop layout see **Layout** bar and **Mobile Layout** for the field.
5. Click on the blue bars to extend the size of the field, for example in the image above, the desktop layout is 50% of the maximum width available, so the field 'Department Manager' would only take up half the width of the form. The mobile layout however is set to 100% and the field would take up the maximum width available. There are 12 possible width options that can be used within these bars. 
6. Click on the **Collapse** button to minimise the Layout property.
