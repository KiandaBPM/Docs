## Introduction ##

As an **Administrator** or someone with the role **Design business process**, you can update **process designs** as often as you need. The **Version number** of a process will be updated every time a process design is saved by clicking on **Save** ![Save button](/images/saveprocess.png).

The **current or active version** of a process is always visible in the right-hand pane, for example V0.34 for the 'Inspection Process' as shown below.

The **first version** of a process is **0.1** and will increment to 0.2 and so on, each time a process is saved. Once the process is **published** the version changes to **1.0** and increments with each publication. 

So for example a first click on the **Publish** button ![Publish button](/images/publish.png) for the process above will make the version **V1.0**.

If the process is subsequently **saved**, then the next version will be **V1.1** and the next **published version** will be **V2.0**.

Using versioning makes it is easy to keep track of changes and to restore the design to an older version if needed. 



## How to get started with Version history ##

1. To view the version history click on the **Design version history** button which may look like V0.1 or whatever is the current version for your process, for example ![View design version history](/images/version.png) or ![Version 0.8](/images/version8.png).

2. A pop-up shows the version history details including when the version was created and who created it. 

   In the example below, there are 8 versions of the process, all are **drafts** indicated by the 0 in front, such as 0.8.

3. Click on a particular version to see the version information, for example forms, fields and rules that were added,  modified or removed.

4. Click on **OK** or **Close** to exit the dialog box, or click on the **arrow** button ![Back arrow](/images/back-arrow.jpg) to go back to the full list of versions.

5. Click on the **Restore** button ![Restore button](/images/restore.png) beside a particular version and then click on **Ok** to confirm that you want to restore to that version. 

   **Note:** the new version of the process will increment following a 'restore' in this example to V0.9, however the **Version history details** dialog box will denote that the version is a restored version.
