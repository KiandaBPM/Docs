## Introduction

A Kianda **components** acts as a smaller version of a **process** made up of **various** control fields and rules. You can **reuse** the component in your process designs to save you time and effort of creating each field and rule combination from the beginning.  To the component you can add all control type fields and rules to match your needs. Creating a component will **significantly** **speed up** your process **creation time** if some of your processes demand **same fields and logic**. For example if a lot of your process designs have a **Personal Details** section where a user needs to fill in their **first** and **last** **name**, **email**, **job role**, **phone** **number** and whatever it may be. To save time on process creation time, you can create **one** component with those exact fields you need and use the component it in various types of process designs.

The component you create can be updated at any time if it needs improvement or to better match your requirements. Once you publish your component it can be used in any process of your choice and any processes that already use your component will be automatically updated.

## How to add, move or remove fields 

Adding, moving and removing fields from a component works exactly the same as within a process. There are three categories of controls (fields):

1. **Input** - There are eight types of Input fields. These include the most commonly used data fields such as text box, user picker, date field, table, checkbox, drop-down and number field. See [Input](/docs/platform/controls/input/) for more information. 
2. **Layout** - There are four Layout fields that serve the purpose of perfecting the layout of your form. They include responsive panels, dialog box, field groups and rich text fields - see [Layout](/docs/platform/controls/layout/) for more information.
3. **Action** - There are four Action fields that allow user interface actions like buttons, links or even signature components - see [Actions](/docs/platform/controls/actions/) for more information.

To start **adding** controls or fields to a form:

1. Select the form you want to work on so that the **Edit Form** button (Pen icon ![Pen button](/images/penicon.png)) appears.
2. Click on a Controls **category** (Input, Layout or Action) and control type in the left-hand pane. For example, you could choose the **Input** category and select **Text box** to insert a text box into your form. 

3. To **move** a control, click on the **Drag handle** button ![Drag handle button](/images/draghandlewhite-frame.png).

4. To **remove** a control from your form, select the field you want to remove, then click on the **Bin/Trash** button ![Bin icon](/images/binicon.png) and click on **OK** to confirm removal.
