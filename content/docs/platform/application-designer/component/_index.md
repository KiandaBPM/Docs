## Introduction

A kianda components acts as a smaller version of a process made up of various control fields and rules. You can reuse the component in your processes to save you time and effort of creating each field from the beginning. A component acts as a panel to which you can add all control type fields and rules to match your needs. Creating a component will significantly speed up your process creation time if some of your processes demand same fields and logic. The component you create can be updated at any time if it needs improvement or to better match your requirements. Once you publish your component it can be used in any process of your choice and any processes that already use your component will be automatically updated.
