Kianda **dashboards** deliver a convenient way to provide insights into how your business processes are performing. Dashboards offer easy reporting, permissions management, quick build, condition-based filtering and many more useful features.

From lists to tiles, filters and charts, dashboards allow you to build full digital experiences to monitor your real-time processes in a few minutes. 

There are 3 steps involved in creating a dashboard:

1. Create a dashboard page.
2. Add one or more widgets.
3. Configure or edit the widgets to make the page look the way you want.

If you are using Kianda predefined processes from the App Store, then dashboards have already been created for you! These are available by clicking on **Dashboard** from the main side menu or left-hand pane.

Before you begin, it is important to be aware that there are **two modes** involved in dashboard pages, an [Edit mode and View mode](#edit-mode-and-view-mode) as described below.



## Edit mode and View mode ##

When using dashboards, there are two modes: **Edit mode** and **View mode**.

### Dashboards View mode ###
When you are in **View mode**, the **Edit** button ![Edit button](/images/edit.png) will be visible to the right in the top menu bar.

![View mode](/images/dashboardgeneral.png)

### Dashboards Edit mode ###
When you click on the **Edit** button ![Edit button](/images/edit-current-page.jpg) you will be in **Edit mode**. When you are viewing a page in **Edit mode**, these options will be available to you along the top of the dashboard page:

- the **Widget menu** where you can insert any of the seven available dashboard widgets
- the **Settings** button ![Settings](/images/settings.png) to make changes to the dashboard page
- the **Bin/Trash** button ![Bin button](/images/binicon.png) to delete the dashboard page

![Page edit mode](/images/editmode.png)

In **Edit mode,** you can also make changes to widgets, such as to Kianda predefined dashboards from the App Store, using the **Update configuration** ![Pen button](/images/pen.png), **Settings** ![Cog button](/images/cog.png)and **Delete** ![Bin button](/images/bin.png) buttons.

If you want to create a dashboard page from scratch go to [How to get started](#how-to-get-started) or if you want to learn more about dashboard widgets go to [Dashboard widgets](#dashboard-widgets).

### Dashboard widgets ###

Kianda comes with **7 predefined dashboard widgets**. Using these widgets, you can quickly and easily create a process dashboard in minutes. 

The dashboard widgets include:

- **Richtext widget**: The Richtext widget can be used to display text, links or images in a dashboard. See [Richtext widget](/docs/platform/pages/richtext/) for more information.

- **Tile widget**: The Tile widget can be used to display a count of instances with different colour schemes. You could also add conditions to a display count - for example, you could add a condition of “Status” equals “In-progress” so that the count of process instances with a status of “In-progress” is displayed. To learn more, go to [Tile widget](/docs/platform/pages/tile/).

- **Chart widget**: Using a Chart widget, you could display a pie chart, bar chart or a line chart in your dashboard. These charts can be used to represent various conditions in a process. For more details, see [Chart widget](/docs/platform/pages/chart/).

- **List widget**: The List widget displays the instances (individual records) of the selected process. It can also be used to connect with any other widget to display the filtered items. See [List widget](/docs/platform/pages/list/) for more details.

- **Filter widget**: The Filter widget can be used to filter process instances based on a field. For example, process instances could be filtered by status. See [Filter widget](/docs/platform/pages/filter/) for more details.

- **Link widget**: The Link widget can be used to add a link to a new process, dashboard or any external sources (such as SharePoint). See [Link widget](/docs/platform/pages/link/) for more details.

- **Walk-through widget**: The Walk-through widget allows you to create a walk-through of a process quickly which could be made available to a user, group or organisation. See [Walk through widget](/docs/platform/pages/walkthrough/) for more details.

When you have added one or more dashboard widgets, you can move the widgets around the dashboard page using the **Drag handle** button. This is possible when you are in **Edit mode**, see [Edit mode and View mode](#edit-mode-and-view-mode).

The options available are the same as those available in the **Create dashboard page** dialog box used to create a new dashboard page  - see [How to get started](#how-to-get-started) - but there are also **two** additional options:

- **Display in mobile footer** - Select this checkbox to display in mobile footer.

- **Hide from navigation** - Select this checkbox if you want to hide this dashboard from the navigation in the left side menu. 

  **Note**: Selecting this option will override whatever options you may have inserted in the '**Visible to**' option in the **Create dashboard page** dialog box. Selecting **Hide from navigation** will mean the dashboard page will not be visible to anyone in the main side menu.

4. Click on the **OK** button to save the changes you have made in the **Edit dashboard page** dialog box (or click on **Close** to exit the dialog box without saving).



### Enabling data export from dashboards ###

Kianda allows users to export the data from dashboards with a simple click. 

This video explains how to set up the configuration to export data from dashboards:

### Offline availability ###

Kianda is a progressive web application. This enables Kianda dashboards to provide insights to the business processes, even in offline mode.

This can be beneficial for businesses with users who will need to complete forms when their device is offline - for example, a business with users who carry out inspections or maintenance in remote locations with no access to the internet. While working offline, the user can still create new process instances or carry out actions on an existing instance.



### Saving changes and version history ###
Make sure to save any changes you make to your Dashboard by clicking on the **Save** button ![Save](/images/saveprocess.png).
