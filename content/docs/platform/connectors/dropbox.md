A **Dropbox** data system connector allows you to the Dropbox cloud file system as a data source for your Kianda forms or dashboards. Dropbox is a personal cloud based file system with many subscriptions including team subscriptions. This allows you to store files online and share them with your team or use it as a backup. This means that as your processes are running they will use the information from the cloud file system or depending on the process, update or delete information at the Dropbox cloud file system. 

## When to use

You can use the Dropbox connector when you want a process within your Kianda subscription to have **access** to your Dropbox cloud file directory. You can **extract** files from Dropbox into Kianda by using the **List** field by connecting your Dropbox connector to the List fields datasource, to learn more about the List field go to [List control](/docs/platform/controls/input/list/). You can also use the Dropbox data connector within the **Data** set of rules, these rules allow you to perform **Create, Read, Update ** and **Delete** (**CRUD**) operations. To learn more about the Data rules, go to [Data rules](/docs/platform/rules/data/).

   - **Authorize** - allows you to **authorize** the connection with your Dropbox account and Kianda. When you click this button, a Dropbox window will open allowing you to log in into your Dropbox to **authenticate** your account.
   - **Status** - represents the current status of the connection.
     - **incomplete** - means that the details of the connector were not fully completed
