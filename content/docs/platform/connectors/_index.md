Connecting to data in Kianda is a breeze. You can quickly connect to a data source, for example data in Salesforce, and use this in Kianda forms and dashboards, creating a **data connector**. 

Kianda comes with a predefined set of data connectors, these include:

- [Active Directory](active-directory/)
- [DocuSign](docusign/)
- [Dropbox](dropbox/)
- [Email](email/)
- [File system](file-system/) 
- [FTP](ftp/) 
- [Google Drive](google-drive/) 
- [MySQL](mysql/) 
- [Office 365](office-365/) 
- [Oracle](oracle-database/) 
- [Powershell](powershell/) 
- [Salesforce](Salesforce/)
- [SAP](sap/)
- [SharePoint](sharepoint/)
- [SQL Server](sql-server/) 
- [Web services](webservices/) 

Click on each of the links above to find out more about each data connector. 

If you have a data source that is not on the list above, you can use SOAP or REST to easily connect to your data source, go to [SOAP](/docs/platform/connectors/soap) or [REST](https://docs.kianda.com/docs/platform/connectors/rest/) for more information.
