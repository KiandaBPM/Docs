A data connector available within Kianda is the **Procore connector**. Procore provide a widely used construction management software to streamline project communication, documentation and analysis. Procore also has project management and financial features, as well as tender management and builder information modeling (BIM) designers. Kianda allows you to connect to Procore as a data connector, providing an easy and seamless way of integrating all your Procore data gathered from these features into your Kianda process.
