Data rules is the category of rules that enables that flow between data connectors and form elements, for example reading or writing data from a database table or performing data manipulation with the [Set form field rule](set_form_field.md) expressions. 



## Getting started with Data rules ##

If you go to **Administration** > **Designer** and click on a process or create a new process, then click on **Add a rule** the Data rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on **Data**.

There are five types of data rules as follows:

- Create item - Use this rule together with a datasource to perform a create / insert query and return data identifiers for use with the form.

- Delete item - Use this rule together with a datasource to perform a delete query and return data identifiers for use with the form.

- Update item -  Use this rule together with a datasource to perform an update query and return data identifiers for use with the form. 

- Find Items - Use this rule together with a datasource to perform a query and return data for use with the form.

- Set form field - This rule is used to update the value of fields in a form. Use this rule to copy content between fields or to apply a custom expression to set the value of a given field.
