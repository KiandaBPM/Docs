## Getting started with Data rules ##

If you go to **Administration** > **Designer** and click on a process or create a new process, then click on **Add a rule** the **Data** rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on **Data**.

There are five types of **Data** rules as follows:

- **Create item** - The create item rule is used to create an item on your data-connection. This is a straight forward rule which allows you to connect to your data source and map inputs. You can also map a data source field or text back to Kianda on success or store an error message on failure.

- **Delete item** - This rule works exactly like Update item rule. To delete an item from your data connection, you could use a data source filter and map data source field or text from a data connection to Kianda form field.

- **Update item** -  At any point, if you would like to update any item on your data connection, use this rule. To find an item to update, you could use a data source filter and map the input fields or text.

- **Find Items** - Use this rule together with a datasource to perform a query and return data for use with the form. To find an item, you could use a data source filter which acts as a conditional bridge between Kianda and data-connections. If the condition is true, you could map the data source field or text to the Kianda form field.

- **Set form field** - This rule is used to update the value of fields in a form. The field value could be simple text or based on a custom expression with the ability to define JavaScript expressions. Use this rule to copy content between fields or to apply a custom expression to set the value of a given field.
