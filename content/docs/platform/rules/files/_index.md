**File management** rules is one category of [rules](rules/Readme.md) to enable operations such as the generation of Word documents, conversion to PDF format and merging PDF files together. These operations are useful when creating Word/Excel files with high fidelity, creating anonymous links which give access to files without permissions.

Take an example of a **Create a file anonymous link** rule. Implementing this rule will result in a **randomly generated link** which will lead to a file that you want to share. This link can be opened in **any browser** and can be **accessible** by anyone and there is **no need for authentication** when opening the link. You can also set the expiry time of the created link which will cause the link not to exist after the specified time. See images below for an example of the **Create a file anonymous link** rule:

There are seven types of **File management** rules as follows:

- **Copy file** - this rule copies a file from one data location to another.

- **Convert to PDF** - this rule converts a Word document to PDF format.

- **Generate word document** - this rule generates a Word document from data associated with a process instance using a user-designed template.

- **Generate excel document** - this rule generates an Excel workbook from data associated with a process instance using a user-designed template.

- **Set existing file** - this rule is used to make an existing file available within a configured file field. 

- **Merge PDF** - this rule merges two or more PDF files into a single PDF file.

- **Create a file anonymous link** - this rule generates file links that can be shared anonymously to external users.
