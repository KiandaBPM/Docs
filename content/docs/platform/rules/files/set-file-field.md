## When to use 
Use this rule when your process requires you to bring an existing file dynamically into the form without having the user uploading such file. For example if proving a mechanism to allow the end user to search for file(s) you might use the results of this search as input of an existing file field based on displayname and file url.

Add this rule to any form component.
