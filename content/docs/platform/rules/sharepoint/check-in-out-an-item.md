This rule allows you to check in or check out an item within SharePoint from Kianda.

 

When to use:

This rule should be used when a user within Kianda wanted to check in or check out an item from SharePoint

You can add this rule:

·    to a field

·    to a form

·    to a process (the rule will run on load)

 

How to use:

To check in or check out an item the first step is to select the SharePoint data source and the list where the item is present which is needed to be checked in/out. 

Next the operation should be selected as to whether it is a check in or a check out. 

You should then also select the itemID field from the Kianda form, which will be used to determine which item is being checked in/out. 

You can then also select a field which will serve as a check in comment field. 

 Finally on success/on error mapping can also be set to populate fields of the form, for further details on success & error mapping please see here:
