### Getting started with SharePoint rules

SharePoint rules are associated with SharePoint specific functionality. These rules are typically used to perform actions with SharePoint connectors that are not related with data, for example resetting SharePoint permissions or adding a user into a group on SharePoint.

There are 10 SharePoint rules as follows:

- **Create a list** - creates a new list in a SharePoint site.	
- **Create a site** - creates a new site on SharePoint, enabling the use of a site template.	
- **Create a group** - creates a new group on SharePoint
- **Find a user** - finds or searches for a user within SharePoint
- **Add a user to a group** - adds a SharePoint user to a SharePoint group. It is important to note the difference between Sharepoint users and Kianda users.  Sharepoint users are users of the Sharepoint system.  Kianda users are users of the Kianda system.
- **Remove a user from a group** - removes a SharePoint user from a SharePoint group
- **Reset an item permission**s - changes the SharePoint permissions for a given list, document or folder.
- **Check in / out an item** - checks in or out a file in SharePoint
- **Get attachments** - reads the attachments from a SharePoint list 	
- **Create anonymous link** - creates anonymous links for a SharePoint held file
