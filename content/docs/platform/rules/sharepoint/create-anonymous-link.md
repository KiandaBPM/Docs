This rule allows you to create an anonymous link for a file within SharePoint from a Kianda form

When to use:

This rule should be used when a file within SharePoint should be shared with an individual via an anonymous link.

You can add this rule:

·    to a field

·    to a form

·    to a process (the rule will run on load)

 

How to use:

The first step in configuring this rule is to select the file field where the desired file is set in Kianda.

The next step is to set the duration of the link, this is by default 6 hours, this can be extended or reduced as needed. 

Finally, you choose a field within Kianda to store this anonymous link, which can then be used to access the file.
