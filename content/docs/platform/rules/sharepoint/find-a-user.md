This rule allows you to find a user from a data source from within Kianda.

When to use:

This rule should be used you wish to pull user data into a Kianda form, i.e. when someone wants to bring in employee information.

You can add this rule:

·    to a field

·    to a form

·    to a process (the rule will run on load)

 

How to use:

To find a user, the first step is to select the data source where the user is located. You will then be presented with two options. First is a radio button to select what search criteria you are using to find the user, i.e. display name, email, or ID. Next the search term field is used to select the Kianda form field which will be used to lookup the user details from the data source. 

Finally on success/on error mapping can be set to populate fields on the form based on the user information, for further details on success & error mapping please see here:
