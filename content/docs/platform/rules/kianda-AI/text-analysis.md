## Introduction

The **Text analysis** rule allows you to analyse small or large amounts of text. There are **two functions** for analysis with the **Text analysis** rule:

- **Sentiment analysis**
- **Extract key phrases**

With each function, the AI is programmed to distil information and meaning from a text block. For example, sentiment analysis can be used to give a **Positive** or **Negative** result on feedback forms or item reviews. The **Extract key phrases** on the other hand is programmed to extract most relevant words or expressions from a block of text.

## When to use

Use this rule when you want to analyse large blocks of text into a **Positive** or **Negative** result with a percentage score, or when you want to extract key phrases. 

You can add this rule:

- [x] to a field
- [x] to a form 
- [x] to a process (the rule will run on load)

## Before you get started

To be able to use the Text analysis rule, there a couple of prerequisites needed in your process. To use both functions, your process needs a **Text box field** which will represent the text that is **targeted** during **Text analysis**. To learn more on how to add a text box to your process, go to [Text box control](/docs/platform/controls/input/textbox/).

To use the **Sentiment analysis** function, you need the following:

- **Text box field** - container which will store the computed sentiment result. **Positive** or **Negative**.
- **Number field** - container used to store the **percentage score** of the result. To learn on how to add a number field to your process, go to [Number control](/docs/platform/controls/input/number/).

To use the **Extract key phrases** function, you will need the following:

- **Text box field** - container which will store all of the most relevant words or expressions.
