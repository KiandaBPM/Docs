### Introduction

When working with rules in forms, a key principle to consider is **rule order**. This is important if there are **multiple rules** attached to an item like a button. In this case the order of execution is important and can be modified to suit your needs.

For example, you may want a **Send email rule** to be executed once the **Submit** button is clicked. This will result in an automated email to a designated person. You may also want to attach a report to this email, a report that is a complete form. In this example a **Generate word** **document** **rule** could be used to generate a report when the **Submit** button is clicked. In this example the **Generate word document rule** has to be executed before the **Send email rule**, so that the Word document can be generated and then attached to the email. 

The rule order consideration is therefore particularly important when rules are dependent on each other - where the output of one rule is the input of another rule.

### Changing the rule order of multiple rules

In the example below we will look at changing the rule order of a Send email rule attached to a Submit button. The **Submit**, **Save** and **Close** buttons by default already have **Submit**, **Save** and **Close** process rules attached, in order to allow form shutdown.

To change rule order, when the rule is created:

1. Click on the item that has multiple rules attached, for example a **Submit** button.
2. Click on **Rules** in the right-hand pane, drag the **Send email** rule to the top of the list by clicking on the rule and drag it to the top of the list, before **Submit**, **Save** and **Close** rules.
