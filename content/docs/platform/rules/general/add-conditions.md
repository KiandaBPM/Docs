Conditions can be applied throughout your Kianda form to ensure your rules, etc. only run at specific points depending on certain criteria being met. 

**When to use:** 

Conditions should be used when a rule should only be triggered at a specific point, i.e. an email only being sent if the status of a request is not closed.

 

**You can add this rule:**

·    to a field

·    to a form

·    to a process (the rule will run on load)

 

**How to use:**

\1.    When you edit the condition, the first thing you will select is the Kianda field which you want the condition to apply to. 

\2.    Next you select the match type of the filter, i.e. equal to, not equal to, is blank, etc. 

\3.    The third portion of the condition is to select the value you wish to be your filter criteria. This could be either an existing field within Kianda, or it can be a text input you can add directly to the field. 

\4.    You can have multiple conditions and can have one or all of the filter criteria being met via the and/or setting which is available after adding a second condition. 

\5.    It is also possible to add additional condition groups, this will allow you to have multiple different conditions depending on your needs. 

\6.    Click Ok and the condition is now set.
