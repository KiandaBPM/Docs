The format date rule is used to reformat a date field present within your form

**When to use:**

The format date should be used when you wish to amend the formatting of a date field within Kianda, i.e. you receive a date from a data source in one format and which to present it in the form in another format.

 

**You can add this rule:**

·    to a field

·    to a form

·    to a process (the rule will run on load)

 

**How to use:**

1. The first step you select the date field you wish to reformat. 

2. You then need to select what unit the time is, whether it is a minute, hour, day, etc. 

3. Then you select when the date is to be compared to i.e., a date field, today, or now. 

4. You must then select the date field within the destination field which this newly formatted date is to be stored within. 

5. You can also apply a condition to the rule, to restrict when it will run, more details on conditions can be found here: [https://docs.kianda.com/docs/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/](https://docs.kianda.com/docs/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/)
