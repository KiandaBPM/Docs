## Introduction

The **add time to date** rule allows you to add time to a date field in order to have a future date set within your form. This rule can remind users through set intervals to complete a process instance before a set time. Below is the add time to date rule edit screen.

## When to use

The add time to date rule should be used when a user wishes to add time to a date, i.e. for a reminder email to be sent after 24 hours or another chosen interval.

 

You can add this rule:

- [x] to a field
- [x] to a form 
- [x] to a process (the rule will run on load)



## Before you get started

In advance of using this rule, you need to have **created one or more forms, complete with control fields**. For example, you must have a created field in your form that the add time to date rule can be applied to.

 



## How to get started

1. The first step is to click on an existing field, form or process that you would like to be the executor of the rule.

2. Once highlighted, navigate to **Add a rule** > **Dates** > **Add time to date**.

3. Then you must select the time to add to your date field under **Time to add or a field**, which can either be a numerical value, or can be another field within your Kianda form. These will be the set intervals passed through to your chosen field, form or process. 

4. You then need to select what unit the time is, whether it is a minute, hour, day, etc., using the **Time unit** drop down list. 

5. Then under the **To date** field, you select when the date is to be added from i.e., a date field, or today.

6. You must then select within the **Destination date field**, the date field which this new date is to be stored within.

7. Under **Date calculation settings**, you can also select whether the time added to your chosen date field is within business hours or if it includes weekends. This setting could be utilised to disallow notifications sent outside of working hours, and during unsociable hours. You can also define custom special dates and save them accordingly.

8. Finally, clicking on the **ok** button will save the new rule you have just created and apply it to the chosen field.
