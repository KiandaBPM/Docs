The add time to date rule allows you to add time to a date field in order to have a future date set within your form.



## When to use the Add time to date rule

When to use:

The add time to date rule should be used when a user wishes to add time to a date, i.e. for a reminder email to be sent after 24 hours.

 

You can add this rule:

- [x] to a field
- [x] to a form 
- [x] to a process (the rule will run on load)



## Before you get started

In advance of using this rule, you need to have **created one or more forms, complete with control fields**. For example, you must have a created field in your form that the add time to date rule can be applied to.

 







**How to use:**

1. The first step you select the time to add to your date field, this can be either a numerical value, or can be field within Kianda. 

2. You then need to select what unit the time is, whether it is a minute, hour, day, etc. 

3. Then you select when the date is to be added from i.e., a date field, or today. 

4. You must then select within the destination field the date field which this new date is to be stored within. You can also select if it is business hours so the time is set to within your working hours.

5. Finally, you can decide to exclude weekends or special dates within your date calculation, using the date calculation settings & the special date settings.
