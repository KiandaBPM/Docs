The compare dates rule is utilized to compare two date fields and store the difference between them in a Kianda form field.

**When to use:**

The compare dates rule should be used when a user wishes to compare one date with another from within Kianda.

 

**You can add this rule:**

·    to a field

·    to a form

·    to a process (the rule will run on load)

 

**How to use:**

1. The first step you select the date to compare which the calculation will start from. 

2. You then need to select what unit the time is, whether it is a minute, hour, day, etc. 

3. Then you select when the date is to be compared to i.e., a date field, today, or now. 

4. You must then select the date field within the destination field which this new date is to be stored within. You can also select if it is business hours so the time is set to within your working hours.

5. You can also count only full minutes via a yes/no option, so the resulted time will be a rounded to the minute. 

Finally, you can decide to exclude weekends or special dates within your date calculation, using the date calculation settings & the special date settings.
