**Date** rules is one category of [rules](rules/Readme.md) to allow date calculation and manipulation for example to add time units to a date, to compare dates and allow customised formatting of date display.



## Getting started with Date rules ##

If you go to **Administration** > **Designer** and click on a process or create a new process, then click on **Add a rule** the **Date** rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on **Dates**.

There are four types of **Date** rules as follows:

- **Add time to date** - this rule allows the addition of time to a date which can be based on a chosen parameter such as starting from now, today or another specified value. 

- **Calculate time** - this rule calculates the number of times unites between two dates, or from now.

- **Compare dates** - this rule allows the comparison of date fields to know if one date is for example, between dates, before or after a given date.

- **Format date** - this rule applies custom formatting to input date fields.
