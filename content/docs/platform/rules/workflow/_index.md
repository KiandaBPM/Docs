Kianda workflow rules represent the actions a user intend to perform when they interact with form components. Below are the workflow rules:

1. ### Hide or disable 

   This rule is used to hide, disable, show or enable one or more fields, one or more sections or entire forms. This rule has special meaning in terms of workflow allowing the application to direct user action and flow by hidding or showing entire sections of the application.

2. ### Go to form 

   Go to form rule navigates the user from the current form to the destination form. This rule could also set the destination form's display mode.

3. ### Assign form 

   This rule enables dynamic form ownership and form security assigment of a form owner by assigning a user or a group to a form. You could also choose to override or append the form owner. By default only form owners can see the form in edit 

4. ### Process security 

   This rule defines the security of the entire process instance (record). Using this rule, you could add any user or group with the right permissions to view/update any instances.

5. ### Start a (sub) process

   Start a process rule helps you create a new instance of the same process or a different process. You could also map the inputs from the current instance to a new instance.

6. ### Schedule a rule 

   This rule helps you schedule a rule/rules to be triggered one time, with a recurring schedule or immediately. For example, this rule could be used to schedule a daily reminder email to a user if the task is not complete.
