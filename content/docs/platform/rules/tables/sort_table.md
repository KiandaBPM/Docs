FROM HELP??
Yes, you can easily do that. First of all, you will need a File upload input, so you can upload the file from your computer. Then, you can create the rule wherever it suits you. On the example, we created a button specifically to map the CSV file to the table.

Click on the button to add the rule.
Navigate to Tables > Import CSV.
Select the CSV file field where you will upload the CSV file.
On the CSV Separator, as the data on our CSV file is separated in columns, we are using the " | " sign.
Select the number of columns expected.
You can skip the first line, in case you have a header row in your file.
Select the destination table.
You can alternatively, override existing table fields.
Select the mapping options and click 'OK'.
