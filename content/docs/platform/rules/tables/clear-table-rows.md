This rule allows you to clear rows from a table within Kianda.

When to use:

This rule should be used when working with a table in Kianda and you want to clear the rows from a table. 

You can add this rule:

·    to a field

·    to a form

·    to a process (the rule will run on load)

 

How to use:

1. To clear table rows, the first step is to select the table which you want to clear the rows from.

2. Following this you will select the criteria for the table row deletion. This will determine which rows within the table will be deleted. 

3. The criteria for row deletion is configured the same as a condition, meaning you set the criteria for deletion, akin to filtering when a rule should be triggered via the edit condition. More details on this can be found here:

Once these fields are set you can also set conditions on the rule, further details on conditions can be found here:
