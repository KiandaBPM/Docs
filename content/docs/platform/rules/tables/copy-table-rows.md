---

This rule allows you to copy table rows within Kianda from one table to another.

When to use:

This rule should be used when working with a table in Kianda and you want to copy a row from a table and copy it into a different table.

You can add this rule:

·    to a field

·    to a form

·    to a process (the rule will run on load)

 

How to use:

1. To copy a table row, within the rule configuration you will be presented with two options

2. **Table to copy row from** & **Table to copy row to.**

3. The **Table to copy row from** is used to confirm which table the row you want to pull the information from.

4. The **Table to copy row to** is used to confirm which table you want to populate with the first table row. 

Once these fields are set you can also set conditions on the rule, further details on conditions can be found here:
