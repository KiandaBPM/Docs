title: "Field Display mode"
---

The **Field display mode** rule temporarily changes the display mode of a field or form creating a temporary form or field display mode. This rule forces the display mode to override the automatically calculated display mode of fields and forms.		
**Note**: Form state (Edit / Read) will not be saved. It is recommended that display mode is reverted once no longer needed.

### When to use

You can add this rule:

- [x] to a field
- [x] to a form 
- [x] to a process (the rule will run on load)



### How to use

To implement the rule:

1. Select a field to attach the rule to.

2. Click on **Add a rule** > **Form actions** > **Field display mode**. 

3. In the **Edit rule - Field display mode** dialog box, give the rule a **Title**. 

4. Under **Field or form** select a field or form to change the display mode.

5. Choose from **Edit mode** or **Read mode**. 

6. Click on **Add** to add as many fields or forms as needed.

7. Conditions can be set for these actions, see [Conditions](/docs/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/) for more information.
