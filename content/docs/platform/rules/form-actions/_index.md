Rules within the form action rules allow to perform form specific actions such as saving a form / process, submiting a form, closing a form, deleting a process and validating form input.

There are six form action rules as follows:

- Validate input - provides ability perform flexible data validation and prevents incorrect data submission
- Field display mode - this rule forces the display mode to override the automatic display mode of fields and forms
- Submit form - marks the current form as complete and makes it read-only 
- Save form - commits a record or process instance in the server 
- Close form - closes the form and navigates to another resource
- Delete form - marks the record or process instance to be deleted
