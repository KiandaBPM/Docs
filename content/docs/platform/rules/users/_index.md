User rules is one category of [rules](rules/Readme.md) to enable operations based on user attributes, such as updating user properties and looking up users in a data connector by property.



## Getting started with User rules ##

If you go to **Administration** > **Designer** and click on a process or create a new process, then click on **Add a rule** the User rules are found in the left-hand pane when you click on **Users**.

There are four types of User rules as follows:

- **Get user property** - this rule is used to get data from a selected user profile.

- **Lookup user by property** - this rule is used to look up a user by attribute, for example email address.

- **Invite partner** - this rule sends an invitation to a contact in a partner organisation for them to access a shared process. 

- **Update user property** - this rule is used to update a property in a user profile.
