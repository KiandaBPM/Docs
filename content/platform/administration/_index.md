The **Administration** menu contains all the functions you need to maintain your workspace.

The menu is found on the top right toolbar under the cog icon. This menu will only appear if you have an administrative role, for example **Administrators** will see all items.

Other roles like **Developer**, **Design business process**, **Manage portals**, **Manage Datasources** will have access to the Administration menu, but will only see role-related items within the menu. For example a Developer will only see **Developer** within Administration, while a person with a Design business process role will only see **Designer** within Administration. User roles are set by Administrator who will have access to the **Users** function within administration, see [Users and Groups](/platform/users-groups/) for more information. 

If you have full administration access then you will see nine functions by default within administration. These are:

- **Designer** - users with the Designer business process role and administrators can access this function to design business processes. Designer is the main feature that allows you to design process apps using the form designer.

- **Settings** - administrators can update an organisation's subscription details, including Single Sign On, workspace look and feel, mobile app login design, storage files and regional settings.

- **Data sources** - users with the **Manage data sources** role and administrators can access this function to manage centrally data sources in the workspace. These connectors can be used to retrieve data for processes and processes can automate the update and manipulation at the data source location.

- **Scheduled tasks** - administrators can access this function to schedule tasks which can be full processes or parts of a process, for example to execute a rule, and schedule these tasks for a desired period or on demand. Within this function you can also view all existing scheduled tasks that could be rules executing within a process such as scheduled reminders. 

- **Recycle bin** - administrators can access deleted processes, tasks and process instances in the recycle bin and restore them to their original location.

- **Users & Groups** - administrators can manage user accounts using this function for example setting roles, profile properties, creating and deleting groups.

- **Portals** - Users with the Manage partners role and administrators can access this function to invite business partners to view processes. 

- **Developer** - Developers and administrators can access this function to create customised field, rule and dashboard widgets.

- **Support** - This provides a shortcut to the application logs and access to system support functions.
