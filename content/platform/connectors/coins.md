A data connector available within Kianda is the **Coins connector**. Coins provide general construction management solutions from budgeting and time management, to communications logs and operations management. This data connector allows you to seamlessly integrate your Coins data within your Kianda process, to increase workflow productivity from one central Kianda workspace.
