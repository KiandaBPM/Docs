There are six **Form action** rules as follows:

- **Validate input** - provides ability perform flexible data validation and prevents incorrect data submission

- **Field display mode** - this rule forces the display mode to override the automatic display mode of fields and forms

- **Submit form** - marks the current form as complete and makes it read-only 

- **Save form** - commits a record or process instance in the server 

- **Close form** - closes the form and navigates to another resource
