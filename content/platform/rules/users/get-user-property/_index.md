## Introduction

The **Get user property** rule allows you to retrieve a **property** of a user that has been selected. You can select a user by defining one in a **user picker** field or selecting the **current user**, meaning that the user currently filling out the form will be selected when retrieving a profile property of a profile attribute. For example you can retrieve properties such as **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email** or **Phone number** of a current user, those property values can be used fill in fields associated with a user.

## When to use 

Use this rule when you need to retrieve a profile property or a profile attribute from a current user or a user defined in a user picker field. 

You can add this rule:
- [x] to a field
- [x] to a form 
- [x] to a process (the rule will run on load)

## Before getting started

In advance of using the **Get user property** rule, in your process you need to have created at least one or more forms. The rule also requires you to select a **user profile source**, the source can be the **current user** of the form or a user chosen within a **User picker** field. When selecting the **current user** option, you will target the **property** of the user that is **currently** using the form. When you pick the **user picker field**, you need to create a **User picker** field which is used to select a user to target when **retrieving** a property.  The rule also requires a **text box** field which is used as a **container** to store the **retrieved value** of the property.

- **User picker (required)** - field used to select a user for which you want to update a property. To learn more about user picker field go to [User picker control](/platform/controls/input/user-picker/).
- **Text box (required)** - field used as a container to store the value of the property. To learn more about text box field go to [Text box control](/platform/controls/input/textbox/).
