## Introduction

The **Form quick action** menu will appear to designated users as a quick action menu option in the top right-hand corner of a form.

Depending on what type of quick actions are enabled and if you are assigned quick actions as a form user,, then you will see options when you click on the **quick action** button ![Quick action menu](/images/quick-action-button.jpg), for example to reassign a form to someone else, or to perform a custom action like signing off on a purchase order.
