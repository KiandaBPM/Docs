**Process navigator** can be found in each **process design** in the right-hand pane. The navigator is used to help you navigate to **fields** and **rules** that are present within you process. By clicking on a field for example, you will be navigated specifically to where the field is within your process while also **highlighting** the field with a **border** for a **short period** of time. You can also do the same for **rules**, once you click on a rule in the navigator, you will be brought to the form where the rule is located and it will highlight the specific field that the rule is attached to.

The very useful **feature** of the **process navigator** is its **search bar**. With big processes that contain many **forms, fields and rules** can be overwhelming and time consuming to look for a particular filed or rule. You can simply **type** in the **name** of the filed/rule and options will appear under the Process Navigator

3. Click on the field you wish to **navigate** to. The navigator will **jump straight** into the form that the field is in and the field itself will be **highlighted** for a **brief period** of time. See the image below for an example when navigating to a **Comments** field within a process design:

### How to search for a filed/rule

The very useful **feature** of the **process navigator** is its **search bar**. With big processes that contain many **forms, fields and rules** can be overwhelming and time consuming to look for a particular filed or rule. You can simply **type** in the **name** of the filed/rule and options will appear under the Process navigator.

1. In the provided search textbox of the process navigator, type in the **Name** of the filed or rule your trying to navigate to.

2. Once you start typing, fields and rules will start to **show** that **contain** the **text** within the search textbox.

   In the above image you can see that when the word **date** is entered, all fields and rules that contain the word **date** will show in the process navigator. You can then click on the desired field/rule for the navigator to navigate you to the location.
