A dashboard **Rich Text widget** can be used to create custom rich text content on a dashboard page, such as an attractive banner or heading. It can provide optimum formatting options, such as bold and italics and the option to insert images or links.



## How to get started

To add a **Rich Text widget** to a dashboard:

1. Open the relevant dashboard page. To learn how to create your first dashboard page, go to [How to create a dashboard page](/platform/pages#how-to-create-a-dashboard-page). 

   For this example, we'll open a dashboard page called 'Annual Leave' that currently only has a [List widget](/platform/pages/list/) on it:

   ![Annual Leave dashboard page example](/images/dashboard-annual-leave-example.jpg)

2. Click on the **Edit current page** button from the top dashboard menu to go into [Dashboard Edit mode](/platform/pages#dashboards-edit-mode) (in which the **Widget menu**, **Settings** button ![Settings](/images/settings.png), **Bin/Trash** button ![Bin trash button](/images/bin.png) and **Add layout container** button ![Dashboard Add layout container button](/images/dashboard-add-layout-container.jpg) are available):

   ![Click Edit current page button to go into Edit mode](/images/dashboard-edit-button.jpg)

3. Click on the **Rich Text widget** button in the Dashboard **Widget menu**.

   ![Select the Rich Text button in the Dashboard Widget menu](/images/dashboard-select-richtext.jpg)

4. The **Add widget** dialog box opens with a range of options for your new **Rich Text widget**.

   ![Dashboard Add widget dialog box](/images/dashboard-add-widget-dialog.jpg)

   Choose the options you want:

   - **Title** - You can insert the title you want for your **Rich Text widget**. In our example, we'll call it 'Information'.

   - **Layout columns** - You can choose how wide you want your **Rich Text widget** to be. You can choose from 1 to 12 columns in width by clicking on the blue bar. For example click half-way across the blue bar to create a widget that is 6 columns wide, or click on the right of the blue bar to create a column that is 12 columns wide.

   - **Colour scheme** - You can choose from six colour options for the header of the widget (Navy, Green, Blue, Amber, Red or White).

   - **Show header** - You can choose whether or not you want the header of your Dashboard widget to be shown.

   - **Visible to** - You can determine who will be able to see the **Rich Text widget**. You can select single or multiple Users or Groups, or a combination of the two. You can select Users or Groups in the right-hand menu so that the options shown in the drop-down list are either individual users or Groups.

     To find out more about pre-defined Groups on Kianda, go to [Users & Groups](/platform/administration/users).

     - **Note - Dashboard page security**: When a dashboard page is first created, the users(s)/group(s) who will be able to view the dashboard are selected in the '**Visible to**' option in the **Create dashboard page** dialog box (see Step 3 in [How to create a Dashboard page](/platform/pages#how-to-create-a-dashboard-page)). 

       You can also edit or update this setting at any point to change who has permission to view a particular dashboard page. This higher dashboard-level security setting will take precedence over the security settings ('Visible to') that are applied to the *individual widgets* within the dashboard (such as the Rich Text widget, in this case).

       See [Dashboard security](/security/process-level-security#dashboard-security) and [Widget security](/security/process-level-security#widget-security) for more information.
   
   - **Layout container** - This option will only display if you have already created layout containers for your Dashboard page. Here, you can select which layout container you want your new **Link widget** to be placed in.
   
     A layout container is a simple way to organise, arrange and move the widgets you add to your dashboard. To learn more about layout containers, go to [How to add layout containers to a Dashboard page](/platform/pages#how-to-add-layout-containers-to-a-dashboard-page).
   
     In this example, we can select to place our new Rich Text widget into one of three layout containers - Top, Middle or Bottom:

		![Dashboard Add widget dialog box select Layout container](/images/dashboard-select-layout-container.jpg)
		
	- **Device visibility** - You can choose what devices and types of internet connections the dashboard **Rich Text widget** will be visible on - select all the options you want from Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, Wi-Fi and Flight mode as to when the device can view the dashboards. By default, all options are selected.

5. Click on **OK** when you've completed the **Add widget** dialog box.

6. An **Edit content** dialog box automatically opens:

   ![Dashboard Rich Text widget Edit content dialog box](/images/dashboard-richtext-edit-dialog.jpg)

   - Insert the content you want to appear in your **Rich Text widget** by using the available options.

   - Insert the text you want to appear in the body of the **Edit content** dialog box. You can choose from an wide array of styles and formats, including: **Style**, **Colour**, **Bold**, **Underline**, **Remove font style**, **Font size**, **Font family**, **Unordered list**, **Ordered list**, **Paragraph**, and **Table**. 

   - You can also choose to insert a **Link** or **Picture** or to switch to **Code view** (if you click on **Code view** button ![Code view button](/images/code.png)you can copy HTML code directly into the text). 

   - If you click on the **Picture** button ![Picture button](/images/picture-button.jpg)you will be redirected to the **File storage** area where you can search for existing images stored in the Kianda file system, you can also create a folder, upload or delete a file. 

   ![Storage files management area](/images/storage-files-upload.jpg)

   

   For our example, we will insert text details relating to the Annual Leave dashboard, format them as we want, and also insert a suitable image:

   ![Dashboard Rich Text widget Edit content dialog box example](/images/dashboard-richtext-edit-content.jpg)

   

7. Click on the **OK** button when you are finished inserting the content you want in your **Rich Text widget** or click on **Close** to exit the dialog box without saving. 

8. Your **Rich Text widget** will now be displayed on your dashboard. Click on **Save** ![Dashboard Save button](/images/dashboard-save-button.jpg) in the dashboard top menu to save the insertion of the new widget.
