Kianda's REST Application Programming Interface (API) can be used to perform operations or methods such as create, update and get/retrieve items on a number of key areas that include:

- **Processes** - namely process designs created by **administrators** or **designers** in [Kianda Designer](/platform/application-designer/designer/)
- **Instances** - namely instances of processes or records created by **form users** who have **saved** or **submitted** details in a [process instance](/platform/application-designer/process/process-instance/)
- **Tasks** - namely scheduled tasks created by **administrators** or instigated by processes, as seen in the [Scheduled tasks](/platform/administration/scheduledtasks/) function within **Administration**

The following pages introduce APIs for the above. In all cases [Authentication](/apis/authentication/) is required for requests.
