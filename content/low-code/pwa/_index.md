## What is a PWA?

A **Progressive Web Application (PWA)** is a web-based application that delivers a native app-like experience on any device—mobile, tablet, or desktop—without requiring an app store download. PWAs leverage modern web technologies to offer features such as offline availability, push notifications, and fast load times, all while maintaining the convenience and accessibility of a standard website.

By running Kianda as a PWA, you gain a flexible, secure, and user-friendly solution for enterprise mobility without the overhead of traditional mobile app distribution. Accessing Kianda through a PWA feels like using a native app, but with the continuous updates and centralized maintenance of a cloud-based web application.

## Why Choose a PWA for Enterprise Applications?

- **No App Store Submission:**  
  Distribute and update your enterprise application directly. Users can “install” Kianda from their browser without going through an app store.
  
- **Offline Capability:**  
  Work seamlessly—even without network access. Tasks, forms, and process instances can be completed offline and automatically synced when connectivity returns.

- **Fast and Responsive:**  
  Thanks to caching and efficient resource handling, PWAs load quickly. Users benefit from smoother interactions and better performance on all devices.

- **Engaging User Experience:**  
  Receive timely push notifications and view content in a user-friendly interface that adapts to any screen size. Add your brand’s icon and color scheme for a polished, consistent experience.

- **Enhanced Security:**  
  PWAs use secure HTTPS connections, leveraging browser-level security features like SSL encryption to protect data in transit.

## Key Benefits of Using Kianda as a PWA

### Offline Use  
If users are in areas with limited or no connectivity—such as remote worksites or underground facilities—the PWA ensures they can still fill out forms, submit inspections, or log tasks. Changes made offline sync automatically when the device reconnects, eliminating data loss and downtime.

### Improved Performance  
PWAs cache essential resources locally, reducing load times and improving reliability. Users enjoy instant access to Kianda processes and forms, contributing to better productivity and user satisfaction.

### Easy Installation and Maintenance  
Installing Kianda as a PWA is as simple as adding it to your home screen. Since updates happen behind the scenes over the web, there’s no need for users to download updates manually. Your IT team can roll out new features or fixes instantly, ensuring everyone is always on the latest version.

### Brand Consistency and Engagement  
Customize the PWA’s splash screen, icons, and theme colors to match your company’s identity. With push notifications enabled, you can engage your workforce, sending timely updates or alerts that improve communication and responsiveness.

### Cross-Platform and Responsive  
Kianda’s interface adapts to various screen sizes and devices. Whether users access it from a smartphone, tablet, or desktop browser, they enjoy a consistent, intuitive experience. This adaptability also reduces development costs and complexity.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Encourage Users to Install the PWA:**  
  Provide instructions or internal communications explaining how easy it is to install Kianda as a PWA, ensuring widespread adoption.

  If your organization uses push notifications, remind users that they can disable them if desired. For users who opt-in, timely and relevant notifications can improve engagement and responsiveness.

- **Regular Updates:**  
  Keep refining and updating your Kianda processes. Since PWAs update automatically, users always have access to the latest forms and features without manual intervention.

  Periodically test offline scenarios to ensure forms and tasks behave as expected without connectivity. This helps maintain user trust and productivity.
