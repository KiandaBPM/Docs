Kianda is a **Progressive web application**. PWA's are the next generally the recommended way for deploying mobile applications for enterprise use. They do not require publishing to app stores but provide all the advantages of native mobile applications like push notifications and offline availability. 

The Kianda platform is a progressive web application, you can access your businesses' Kianda workspace as if it were a native mobile application. 

Instead of having to download an application through your device's native application store, the PWA can be formatted and installed on your device so that you can easily access the website via a URL shortcut. This means with Kianda you get a digital experience that is native-like while maintaining online web benefits. When you have a Kianda subscription, you gain the ability to access your workspace via a PWA. Seen below is the accessing of the Kianda platform via a PWA on an android device.

## Benefits

There are several benefits of using a PWA app when comparing to a web app or even a native only app.

### Offline Use

Apps keep working with or without network access, allowing for **offline availability** of resources. Even when your users are going through a tunnel or in a lift, changes are automatically queued offline and then **synchronised** when connectivity is restored. This can be extremely useful when completing process instances in remote locations, for example filling out an inspection form in an area with no internet coverage.

### Fast Performance

The app loads quickly thanks to having it installed locally on your device. This provides you with an increased **ease of access** experience as you are not required to download the application via your device's native application store. Progressive web apps are faster because of the way the underlying technology **caches** and serves text, stylesheets, images and other content on the websites. As a result user experience, consistency and conversion rate increase.

### Engaging

When installing on your home screen with your brand icons, users receive **timely push notifications** that help them stay engaged. If you would prefer to not receive notifications, you can disable them and relevant updates will be executed in the background silently.

### Secure

PWAs make use of **HTTPS requests** to transfer data, which minimises potential security threats. As these applications access your Kianda workspace through your chosen web browser, PWAs utilise the added security features of these web browsers such as **SSL encryption**. 

### Responsive

The Kianda platform is designed to be responsive on a myriad of mobile devices which reduces any future developmental costs. PWAs employ the **adaptive** nature of HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that your Kianda workspace will consistently maintain a neat display of features.
