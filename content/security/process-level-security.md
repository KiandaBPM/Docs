## Introduction

In addition to [Workspace security](/security/workspace-security/) that is setting levels of access by role and form ownership, there are a multitude of ways to set access at a process, field and dashboard level. The following sections describe security at different levels. 

## Process security settings

When you are creating or editing a process in Kianda Designer, you can set security settings for that process. This setting will **apply to every record (instance)** created from that process. To do this, click on the process in Designer and then, in the right-hand pane, click on the **Settings** button ![Process settings button](https://academy.kianda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/settings.png) and select the checkbox beside **Enable process security.**

Choose an individual user, groups or partner or combination, to be ‘security users’ and then choose from one of three security modes, as shown in here.

The three available security levels are listed from lowest to highest. For example, if you choose **Security users only can create, view and update** means that only the users listed as **Process security users** – in the example shown here, Mike Balcoome and the Management Team – will be able to access and view process records. No other users will have access to the process records generated by this process.

## Process security rule

Another way to set security is to use one of the **Workflow** rules called **Process security** to **dynamically change** the security settings for a process record (instance). Using this rule allows you to set the same security modes shown in the process settings above, but this can happen based on a particular condition or trigger – for example, clicking the Submit button.

To add this rule, open your process in Kianda Designer and select the relevant form. Then, in the left-hand pane, go to **Add a rule** > **Workflow** > **Process security**. In the Edit rule – Process security dialog box, create a condition if desired, and then choose from the type of users who will become security users. Choose from the options: **Override** to override existing security, or **Append** if you want to add a new level of access. Click the **Enable security** checkbox to choose a Process security mode.

## Panel and button security

In addition to process and form level security, you can set panel and button security by clicking on a panel or button within a form. Click on the panel or button of choice, click the **Edit** button (Pen icon) and choose **Yes** beside **Enable security**. Click on the **Add security** button to add users or groups to enable access to the button or panel.

## Dashboard security

As an end user, when you login to Kianda, you are presented with dashboards and widgets for different processes. The dashboard is made of multiple widgets like tiles, charts, links and lists. Go to [Dashboard](/platform/pages/) to find out more about each widget type. You can set security at both a) dashboard level and b) widget level, see [Widget security](#widget-security) for more details. This section will deal with dashboard level security.

Dashboard level security can only be applied if you have the **Administrator** role to allow visibility of **dashboards and widgets.**

To apply security to dashboards:

1. Go to the existing dashboard page by clicking on **Dashboard** and the page name in the left-hand side menu.

2. Click the **Edit** button ![Edit button](/images/edit.png) visible in the top menu bar.

3. Now in **Edit mode**, the **Settings** button  ![Settings button](/images/settings2.png) is visible. Click on the **Settings** button.

4. The **Edit dashboard page** dialog box appears where you can find the **Visible to** user picker with an option to select **Users** and/or **Groups**.

5. Select the correct **Users** and/or **Groups** using the dropdown menu.

6. Make any other changes you need to the dashboard, see [Dashboard](/platform/pages/) for more details. 

7. Click on **OK** when you are finished editing the dialog box or **Close** to exit the dialog box at any time.

8. Save the changes you make by clicking on the **Save** button ![Save button](/images/save-dash.png) at the top of the page.

### Widget security

Similarly, you can set the visibility for an individual widget on the dashboard like a tile, chart, or list, for example, if you want the dashboard to be visible to everyone and a particular chart on the dashboard only visible to management. This can be achieved by setting the **visible to** field to the management group as shown below.

To apply security to a dashboard widget:

1. Go to the existing dashboard page by clicking on **Dashboard** and the page name in the left-hand side menu.

2. Click the **Edit** button ![Edit button](/images/edit.png) visible in the top menu bar.

3. Now in **Edit mode**, click on the **Cog/settings** button ![Widget settings](/images/widget-cog.jpg) of the widget.

4. The **Edit widget** dialog box appears where you can find the **Visible to** user picker with an option to select **Users** and/or **Groups**. The example below shows the dialog box for a **List** widget.

   ![Edit widget dialog box](/images/edit-widget-eg.jpg)

5. In the **Visible to** field select the correct **Users** and/or **Groups** from the dropdown menu.

6. Click on **OK** when you are finished editing the dialog box or **Close** to exit the dialog box at any time.

7. Save the changes you make by clicking on the **Save** button ![Save button](/images/save-dash.png) at the top of the page.
