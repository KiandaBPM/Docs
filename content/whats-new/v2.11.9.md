| 1    | Navigating away from design with changes  - If you click on the **Exit** button to go back to the process list <u>without</u> clicking on the **Save** button you will be prompted with a dialog box detecting **Unsaved changes** prompting you to Abandon changes if desired. Click on **Yes** to exit **Designer** without saving, or **No** to exit and save. |
| 2    | Add Picture Button in send email rule, widget-html and rich-text - If you click on the **Picture** button for example in the Body of a Send email rule, you will be redirected to the **File storage** area where you can search for existing images stored in the Kianda file system, create a folder, or upload a file. |
| 3    | Include Custom widgets when exporting - When you click on **Export** on the **Process designer** page, you can now choose if you would like to include the custom widget that is associated with the selected dashboard/process within the exported Kianda file. The included custom widgets are then recognised when importing the Kianda file.
