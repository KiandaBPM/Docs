### Implement Dynamic Actions and Conditional Logic with Rules

Enhance the functionality of your forms by adding action rules and expressions to controls. Kianda supports over 60 rules, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive forms. 

Common rules include show or hiding controls based on user input, making fields mandatory, navigating between forms, starting subprocesses, sending emails, setting form fields with dynamic values, and performing CRUD operations on data sources. 

These rules can be configured with multiple conditions, providing granular control over the form’s behavior and user interactions.

Whether it's databases like SQL Server, MySQL, or Oracle, third-party services such as Office 365, SharePoint, SAP, Salesforce, or APIs (SOAP and REST), Kianda enables smooth data integration. 

Developers can even create custom data source connectors using a micro-service architecture, ensuring that all business data is accessible and can be leveraged within process apps.
