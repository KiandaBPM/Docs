### Design Forms for Data Collection and Process Structuring

Developers can create forms that collect a wide range of data types including text, numbers, dates, files, and more. Define the process schema by specifying the structure and flow of information, ensuring that all necessary data is captured accurately and efficiently. This flexibility allows for the customization of forms to meet the specific needs of any business process.

### Responsive Form Controls and Layouts

Kianda provides a rich set of controls that can be easily dragged and dropped into forms to create interactive and user-friendly interfaces. From text boxes and dropdown lists to file uploads and signature pads, each control can be customized to ensure a seamless user experience. All controls are mobile responsive, adhering to Bootstrap principles, which means forms will look great and function perfectly on any device.

### Implement Dynamic Actions and Conditional Logic with Rules

Enhance the functionality of your forms by adding action rules and expressions to controls. Kianda supports over 60 rules, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive forms. Common rules include hiding or disabling controls based on user input, making fields mandatory, navigating between forms, starting subprocesses, sending emails, setting form fields with dynamic values, and performing CRUD operations on data sources. These rules can be configured with multiple conditions, providing granular control over the form’s behavior and user interactions.

### Connect Controls to Kianda Process Data or Any Data Sources

Kianda seamlessly integrates with a variety of data sources, allowing controls within forms to connect and interact with external data. Whether it's databases like SQL Server, MySQL, or Oracle, third-party services such as Office 365, SharePoint, SAP, Salesforce, or APIs (SOAP and REST), Kianda enables smooth data integration. Developers can even create custom data source connectors using a micro-service architecture, ensuring that all business data is accessible and can be leveraged within process apps.

### Deploy Process Apps and Access Large-Scale Process Data

With Kianda Pages, developers can publish their process apps, providing users with easy access based on their permissions. This feature supports handling large volumes of data efficiently, employing server-side paging and no-SQL big data stores with dynamic indexing. Users can interact with millions of process records seamlessly, ensuring high performance and quick data retrieval. Kianda Pages makes it simple to deliver powerful, data-driven applications to end-users.

### Unified Interface for Multiple Processes one single page

Kianda Pages allows the integration of multiple related processes into a single, unified interface. By combining multiple process schemas into a single no-SQL data store, developers can create comprehensive views that relate different processes through defined properties. Utilize specialized widgets such as List, Chart, and Filter widgets to display and interact with process data. For example, users can view all incidents and their incomplete actions within a single page, enhancing oversight and management capabilities.

### Automate process tasks with scheduled tasks

Kianda offers robust automation capabilities, enabling developers to schedule tasks that execute user-defined process rules. Scheduled tasks can run based on various time intervals—one-time, every few minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or on-demand via HTTP callbacks. Automate repetitive tasks, such as sending notifications, updating records, or triggering subprocesses, to improve efficiency and reduce manual workload. With Kianda, automating business processes is simple and highly customizable to fit any requirement.
