# Configuring data connectors

Connecting to data in Kianda is a breeze. You can quickly connect to a data source, for example data in Salesforce, and use this in Kianda forms and dashboards, creating a **data connector**. 

Kianda comes with a pre-defined set of data connectors, these include:

- [Active Directory](connectors/active_directory.md)
- [DocuSign](connectors/docusign.md)
- [Dropbox](connectors/dropbox.md)
- [Email](connectors/email.md)
- [File system](connectors/file_system.md) 
- [FTP](connectors/ftp.md) 
- [Google Drive](connectors/google_drive.md) 
- [MySQL](connectors/mysql.md) 
- [Office 365](connectors/office_365.md) 
- [Oracle](connectors/oracle_database.md) 
- [Powershell](connectors/powershell.md) 
- [Salesforce](connectors/Salesforce.md)
- [SAP](connectors/SAP.md)
- [SharePoint](connectors/sharepoint.md)
- [SQL](connectors/sql_server.md) 
- [Web services](connectors/webservices.md) 

Click on each of the links above to find out more about each data connector. 

If you have a data source that is not on the list above, you can use SOAP or REST to easily connect to your data source, go to [link to SOAP and REST] for more information.
