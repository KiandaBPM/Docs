# Configuring data connectors

Connecting to data in Kianda is a breeze. You can quickly connect to a data source, for example data in Salesforce, and use this in Kianda forms and dashboards, creating a **data connector**. 

Kianda comes with a pre-defined set of data connectors, these include:

- [Active Directory](platform/active_directory.md)
- [DocuSign](platform/docusign.md)
- [Dropbox](platform/dropbox.md)
- [Email](platform/email.md)
- [File system](platform/file_system.md) 
- [FTP](platform/ftp.md) 
- [Google Drive](platform/google_drive.md)
