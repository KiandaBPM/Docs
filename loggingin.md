## Logging into Kianda ##

If your organisation already has a login, go to your given Kianda login page. If not, sign up for a free trial by going to https://app.kianda.com/signup. You will be prompted to confirm your email address and you can then login. The Kianda platform runs in the cloud, so you only need a web browser and can use any mobile device to login. 

When you login you will have access to the Kianda **workspace** where you can build end-to-end business processes, connect to datasources and view the results in real-time data dashboards.

The layout of the Kianda workspace is as follows:

1. **Company logo** - the top left-hand corner is reserved for uploading your company logos. If you click on the **Collapse navigation** button ![Collapse navigation button](images/navigation_frame.png) you will see the collapsed version of the company logo and collapsed side menu, giving you more real estate in the central view panel.

2. **Side menu** - This left-hand pane contains all the key functions to create and manage your business processes. From this menu you will start **creating** **processes**. In the side menu, under **More**, there are links to get **Help**, **Support**, and give **Feedback**. From this menu you can also developer your own widgets, see [Developer](developer.md) for more details.

3. **Main view** - this central panel is the main view for any of the functions chosen from the side menu. Here you can **view and edit** processes and dashboards.

4. **Quick Action menu** - the top right-hand menu bar contains shortcuts to keep you updated and allows you to **add dashboard pages**.

Go to [Personalise your workspace](workspacepersonalise.md) to find out to change the look and feel as well as regional settings for your workspace.

Now that you are familiar with the workspace layout, you are ready to get started with producing your first business process in Kianda! If you don't want to start from scratch, choose **Kianda's process templates**, found in the [App Store](kiandaapps.md), where we in Kianda have done all the hard work for you. 

If you have coding experience and want to delve into how you can use Kianda to create your own widgets, go to [Developer](developer.md) to learn more.
